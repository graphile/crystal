# ruru-types

Some TypeScript types from `ruru-components` because `npm` has issues with the
explorer plugin as a peer depenency (due to `react` version mis-match) and this
helps avoid that entering the dependency graph. Also minimizes the dependencies
of `ruru` since most of the complexity is bundled already.
