# Next.js API route

Grafserv does not currently ship an official Next.js adaptor. If you are using
Next.js, run Grafserv in a separate server process (for example the Node or
Express adaptor) and proxy requests from your Next.js app to that server.

If you need direct integration, keep an eye on the Grafserv server adaptors
list and migrate when a Next.js adaptor becomes available.
