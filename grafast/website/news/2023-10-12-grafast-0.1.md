Gra*fast* is finally here - a new holistic execution engine for GraphQL. It enables greater efficiency across the entire backend stack by leveraging the declarative nature of GraphQL to give your business logic a better understanding of everything it needs to do. It’s backwards compatible, so you can adopt it incrementally within your existing schema and it’s finally ready to try with [the `grafast` module on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grafast); or check out [the source code on GitHub](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/tree/main/grafast/grafast)!
