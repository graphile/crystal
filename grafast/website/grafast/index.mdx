# <grafast /> introduction

The GraphQL specification describes how a GraphQL operation should be executed,
talking in terms of layer-by-layer resolution of data using "resolvers." But
critical to note is this sentence from the beginning of the specification:

> _Conformance requirements [...] can be fulfilled [...] in any way as long as
> the perceived result is equivalent._  
> â”€ https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Conforming-Algorithms

Resolvers are relatively straightforward to understand, but when implemented
naively can very quickly result in serious performance issues. [DataLoader][] is
one of the approaches suggested to solve the "N+1 problem," but this is only the
most egregious performance issue that a naive GraphQL schema may face - there
are others such as server-side over-fetching and under-fetching and related
issues that can really build up as your schemas and operations get more complex.

&ZeroWidthSpace;<grafast /> was designed from the ground up to eliminate these issues and more
whilst maintaining pleasant APIs for developers to use. To do this, in addition
to supporting resolvers for legacy fields, <grafast /> favors a planning
strategy that takes a holistic approach to understanding the incoming operation,
and unlocks the potential for significant optimizations not previously
achievable without a herculean effort.

Please note that <grafast /> is not tied to any particular storage or business
logic layer - any valid GraphQL schema could be implemented with <grafast />,
and a <grafast /> schema can query any data source, service, or business logic
that Node.js can query.

:::info

Currently <grafast /> is implemented in TypeScript, but we're working on a
specification with hopes to extend <grafast />'s execution approach to other
programming languages. If you're interested in implementing <grafast />'s
execution algorithm in a language other than JavaScript, please get in touch!

:::

## Planning

_This is just an overview, for full documentation see
[Plan Resolvers](./plan-resolvers)._

In a traditional GraphQL schema each field has a resolver. In a <grafast />
schema, though resolvers are still supported, you are encouraged to instead use
[**plan&nbsp;resolvers**](/grafast/plan-resolvers). These plan resolvers are
generally small functions, like regular resolvers should be, but instead of
being called many times during execution and dealing with concrete runtime
values, they are called only once at planning time and they build and
manipulate **steps** which are the building blocks of an [**execution
plan**](/grafast/operation-plan#execution-plan) which details all the actions
necessary to satisfy the GraphQL request.

Imagine that we have this GraphQL schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  currentUser: User
}
type User {
  name: String!
  friends: [User!]!
}
```

In [graphql-js][], you might have these resolvers:

```ts
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    async currentUser(_, args, context) {
      return context.userLoader.load(context.currentUserId);
    },
  },
  User: {
    name(user) {
      return user.full_name;
    },
    async friends(user, args, context) {
      const friendships = await context.friendshipsByUserIdLoader.load(user.id);
      const friends = await Promise.all(
        friendships.map((friendship) =>
          context.userLoader.load(friendship.friend_id),
        ),
      );
      return friends;
    },
  },
};
```

In <grafast />, we use [**plan resolvers**](/grafast/plan-resolvers) instead,
which might look something like:

```ts
const planResolvers = {
  Query: {
    currentUser() {
      return userById(context().get("currentUserId"));
    },
  },
  User: {
    name($user) {
      return $user.get("full_name");
    },
    friends($user) {
      const $friendships = friendshipsByUserId($user.get("id"));
      const $friends = each($friendships, ($friendship) =>
        userById($friendship.get("friend_id")),
      );
      return $friends;
    },
  },
};
```

As you can see, the shape of the logic is quite similar, but the <grafast />
plan resolvers are synchronous since their job isn't to get the data to use,
but instead to outline the steps required to get the data. For example, since
the `User.friends` Gra*fast* plan resolver cannot explicitly loop through the
data (it hasn't been fetched yet!), it uses an [`each`
step](/grafast/step-library/standard-steps/each) to detail which steps to take
for each item made available later.

:::tip

By convention, when a variable represents a <grafast /> step, the variable will
be named starting with a `$`.

:::

If we were to make a request to the above <grafast /> schema with the following
query:

```graphql
{
  currentUser {
    name
    friends {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

&ZeroWidthSpace;<grafast /> would build an [**operation
plan**](/grafast/operation-plan) for the operation. For the above query, a
[**plan diagram**](/grafast/plan-diagrams) representing the execution portion
of this operation plan is:

<Mermaid chart={mermaidPlan} />

["users and friends" example](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/tree/main/grafast/website/examples/users-and-friends).

For more information about understanding plan diagrams please see
[Plan Diagrams](/grafast/plan-diagrams).

:::

When the same operation is seen again its existing plan can (generally) be
reused; this is why, to get the very best performance from <grafast />, you
should use static GraphQL documents and pass variables at run-time.

The [**execution plan**](/grafast/operation-plan#execution-plan) diagram you
see above is the final form of the plan, there were many intermediate states
that it will have gone through in order to reach this most optimal form, made
possible by <grafast />'s plan lifecycle.

## Plan lifecycle

_This is just an overview, for full documentation see [lifecycle][lifecycle]._

All plan lifecycle methods are optional, and due to the always-batched nature
of <grafast /> plans you can get good performance without using any of them
(performance generally on a par with reliable usage of DataLoader). However, if
you leverage lifecycle methods your performance can go from "good" to
:sparkles:**_amazing_**:rocket:.

One of the great things about <grafast />'s design is that you don't need to
build these optimizations from the start; you can implement them at a later
stage, making your schema faster without requiring changes to your business
logic _or_ your plan resolvers!

As a very approximate overview:

- once a field is planned we **deduplicate** each new step
- once the execution plan is complete, we **optimize** each step
- finally, we **finalize** each step

### Deduplicate

**Deduplicate** lets a step indicate which of its peers (defined by <grafast
/>) are equivalent to it. One of these peers can then, if possible, replace the
new step, thereby reducing the number of steps in the plan (and allowing more
optimal code paths deeper in the plan tree).

### Optimize

**Optimize** serves two purposes.

Purpose one is that optimize lets a step "talk" to its ancestors, typically to
tell them about data that will be needed so that they may fetch it proactively.
This should not change the observed behavior of the ancestor (e.g. you should
not use it to apply filters to an ancestor - this may contradict the GraphQL
specification!) but it can be used to ask the ancestor to fetch additional
data.

The second purpose is that optimize can be used to replace the step being
optimized with an alternative (presumably more-optimal) step. This may result
in multiple steps being dropped from the plan graph due to "tree shaking." This
might be used when the step has told an ancestor to fetch additional data and
the step can then replace itself with a simple "access" step. It can also be
used to dispose of plan-only steps that have meaning at planning time but have
no execution-time behaviors.

In the "friends" example above, this was used to change the DataLoader-style
`select * from ...` query to a more optimal `select id, full_name from ...`
query. In more advanced plans (for example those made available through
[@dataplan/pg][]), optimize can go much further, for example inlining its data
requirements into a parent and replacing itself with a simple "remap keys"
function.

### Finalize

**Finalize** is the final method called on a step, it gives the step a chance to
do anything that it would generally only need to do once; for example a step
that issues a GraphQL query to a remote server might take this opportunity to
build the GraphQL query string once. A step that converts a tuple into an
object might build an optimized function to do so.

## Further optimizations

&ZeroWidthSpace;<grafast /> doesn't just help your schema to execute fewer and more efficient
steps, it also optimizes how your data is output once it has been determined.
This means that even without making a single change to your existing GraphQL
schema (i.e. without adopting plans), running it though <grafast /> rather than
graphql-js should result in a modest speedup, especially if you need to output
your result as a string (e.g. over a network socket/HTTP).
