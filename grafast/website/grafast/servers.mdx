# Servers

The most common use of a GraphQL schema is via an HTTP API. Serving a <grafast />
schema over HTTP is very much the same as serving a regular GraphQL schema over
HTTP, the main difference is that you should use <grafast />'s `execute`/`grafast`
function to execute requests rather than graphql-js' `execute`/`graphql`
function, though it's also really important to memoize the parsing (and ideally
validation) of documents to ensure that the same operation plan can be used
again in future requests.

You can use any GraphQL server that allows you to substitute the `execute`
method with <grafast />'s; we have our native [Grafserv][] server, or you can
use any of the GraphQL servers that Envelop supports with our `useGrafast`
envelop plugin.

:::note

If you maintain a GraphQL server in JavaScript/TypeScript and you want to
add <grafast /> support, don't hesitate to get in touch!

:::

## Grafserv

[Grafserv][] is <grafast />'s companion server; it's probably the fastest
general-purpose GraphQL server available in Node.js, but due to its youth it
doesn't yet have the large ecosystem of extensions that other servers have.
Grafserv automatically implements all optimisations that we could think of for
serving GraphQL schemas over HTTP, including such optimizations as serializing
directly to string without even building objects in memory in the first place!

Read more in [Grafserv's documentation][grafserv].

## Envelop

[Envelop][] is an excellent GraphQL runtime plugin system written by the fine
folks at [The Guild][]; it can be used with most major GraphQL servers in
Node.js (and some in other environments!) so is a great way of
integrating <grafast /> into an existing project. We bundle a `useGrafast()`
envelop plugin which you can use alongside `useParserCache()` to get an
optimized execution pipeline very easily, here's a snippet:

```ts
import { envelop, useExtendContext, useSchema } from "@envelop/core";
import { useGrafast, useMoreDetailedErrors } from "grafast/envelop";
import { schema } from "./schema";

const getEnveloped = envelop({
  plugins: [
    // Use our executable schema
    useSchema(schema),

    // Caching the parser results is critical for Grafast, otherwise it
    // must re-plan every GraphQL request!
    useParserCache(),
    // And we might as well cache validation whilst we're at it:
    useValidationCache(),

    // Pass your GraphQL context here:
    useExtendContext(() => ({ /* ... */ })),

    // This replaces graphql-js' `execute` with Grafast's own
    useGrafast(),
  ],
});
```
