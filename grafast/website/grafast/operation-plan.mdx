# Operation plan

:::tip

If you're unfamiliar with GraphQL terminology such as "selection set", "field",
"type" and so on, please check out our
[Operation Language](https://learn.graphile.org/docs/GraphQL_Operation_Cheatsheet.pdf)
and
[Schema Language](https://learn.graphile.org/docs/GraphQL_Schema_Language_Cheatsheet.pdf)
cheatsheets.

:::

When <Grafast /> sees an operation for the first time, it builds an _operation
plan_, which is the combination of an [**execution plan**](#execution-plan) and
an [**output plan**](#output-plan). To do so, it walks the selection sets
calling the developer-provided field plan resolver (`plan` method) for each
field to determine the _steps_ that need to be executed for that field. That
series of steps, which we'll call the _field plan_, is then woven with all the
other field plans in the operation, to form a directed acyclic graph we call the
_execution plan_. Whilst doing this, <Grafast /> keeps track of which fields
returned which steps, and uses this information to form the _output plan_.
Finally the _execution plan_ is optimized and finalized and the _output plan_ is
finalized, then they are ready for execution.

A simplified version of the process is this:

1. Create the root layer plan.
1. Let `nextSelections` be the selections in the root selection set, each linked
to the root layer plan.
1. While `nextSelections` is not empty:
   1. Let `currentSelections` be `nextSelections`.
   1. Let `nextSelections` be an empty list.
   1. For each field and associated layer plan in `currentSelections`:
      1. Call the field's [plan resolver][plan resolvers].
      1. Call any uncalled [argument applyPlan resolvers][].
      1. **Deduplicate** new steps.
      1. If the field has a selection set:
         1. Add all selections from the field's selection set along with their
         associated [layer plans](#layer-plans) to `nextSelections`.
1. **Tree shake**.
1. **Optimize**.
1. **Tree shake**.
1. **Finalize**.

## Execution plan

The _execution plan_ is (typically[^1]) asynchronous. It is responsible for
fetching all the data required by the operation in as efficient a manner as
possible, and can evolve quite significantly as a result of deduplication, tree
shaking, and optimization.

[^1]:
    If the execution plan contains no asynchronous steps, then it can be
    executed synchronously. This is rare, though, as typically it will contain
    steps that fetch data from remote data sources such as databases or web
    services.

## Layer plans

Every execution plan starts by populating steps into the "root" layer plan
representing request data such as argument input values, variable values,
GraphQL context, root value, constants, and so on. The "root" layer plan always
has a batch size of 1. Any time the batch size might change (up or down), a new
layer plan is introduced; reasons include:

- root - the root of an operation plan
- nullable field - any null (or errors) can be pruned from the batch before being processed
  by the next layer
- list item - when traversing lists, Gra*fast* multiplies up the batch size,
  effectively flattening all the lists therein so we can handle each item in the
  list as an individual entry in the batch
- subscription - represents an individual subscription event
- mutation field - each mutation gets its own layer plan which must complete
  before the next sibling mutation field may execute. Batch size is always 1,
  this is more related to flow control.
- defer - part of incremental delivery
- polymorphic - when abstract types are represented in the schema, the
  polymorphic layer plan is used to resolve them
- polymorphic partition - once abstract types are resolved, if the actions taken
  are sufficiently different, the plan will "branch" such that each batch only
  needs to contain actions relevant to that type
- combined - when resolving an abstract type _within_ an abstract type, we first
  recombine all the previous batches back together before branching out again;
  this avoids exponential branching
- subroutine - used as temporary storage during execution of a subroutine

### Buckets

Layer plans are a plan-time concern; when executing an individual request a
"bucket" stores the data for a layer plan. When the context is clearly
plan-time, it's common to refer to "layer plans" as "buckets" (we even do this
in [plan diagrams](./plan-diagrams.mdx)), but if you are being crisp then the
LayerPlan is the plan-time entity, and the Bucket is the execution-time
representation which stores data for that LayerPlan within that request.

## Output plan

The data fetched by the execution plan will not be in any particular format, and
may have been significantly deduplicated and simplified as part of the
operations. The _output plan_ is responsible for taking the tree of data starting
at the root bucket and formatting it back out as a valid GraphQL response,
including serializing all the leaves correctly and handling nulls and errors
following the GraphQL specification. The output plan always runs synchronously,
though in streaming situations such as GraphQL subscriptions or incremental
delivery (`@stream`/`@defer`) part of the output plan may be executed for each
payload in the underlying stream.

## Constraints

Whilst <Grafast /> is building the operation plan, it may also determine
particular constraints that govern whether the operation plan may be used for a
future request or not. For example, if the request contains
`@skip(if: $variable)` then a different operation plan may be needed depending
on whether `$variable` was `true` or `false`. Where possible, constraints are
kept as narrow as possible to maximize reuse.

When an operation is seen at a future time, <Grafast /> first looks for an existing
operation plan whose constraints fit the request before falling back to creating
a new operation plan.

## Lifecycle events

### Deduplicate

Once a field is fully planned, <Grafast /> will _deduplicate_ the new steps it
has produced, attempting to replace them with existing "peer" steps that already
existed. These "peer" steps will have been constructed via the same step class,
and will have the same dependencies. By deduplicating at this stage (before
planning the child selection set) we help to ensure that the schema remains in
adherence to the GraphQL specification. Deduplication can greatly reduce the
number of steps in the plan, leading to greater efficiency (and easier to
understand plans).

### Tree shake

Once every selection set has been fully visited and every field has been
planned, the execution plan is complete.

Gra*fast* then walks through the output plans, their required steps and those
steps dependencies (and their dependencies and so on), marking them as active.
Any step that is not active is "unreachable" and thus is no longer needed,
therefore it can be be removed from the execution plan.

Certain steps are immune to tree shaking (they're seen as always active), in
particular these include certain system steps, and any step that is marked as
having side effects.

### Optimize

Once the execution plan is complete and the unnecessary steps have been tree
shaken away, <Grafast /> optimizes the plan by calling the `optimize` lifecycle
method on each step that supports it. This gives each step a chance to replace
themselves with more optimal forms by inspecting and interacting with their
ancestors.

:::info

For example if a "first" step is to optimize itself, and its parent is a "list"
step, then it can simply replace itself with the first entry in the list of
plans the "list" step contains. More advanced examples may include topics such
as joining tables in a database, or adding selection sets to a remote GraphQL
operation.

:::

The optimize method is called starting with the dependencies (leaves) and
working its way up the dependents (trunk) of the execution plan's directed
acyclic graph. Since plans should only talk to their ancestors (and not their
descendants) during optimize, this ensures that their dependencies remain what
the class expects until after it is optimized.

Once optimization is complete, <Grafast /> tree shakes again to remove any
unnecessary steps from the execution plan.

### Finalize

Gra*fast* then finalizes the plan by calling the `finalize` method on steps
that support it. This gives each step a chance to do work that need only be done
once, for example:

- a step that talks to a database might compile the SQL it needs and cache it
  for later
- a step that performs templating may build an optimized template function
- etc

### Output plan finalize

Finally, the output plans are finalized, building optimized output functions and
referencing the latest optimized steps.
