# Unary dependency expected

:::info What is a unary step?

See [unary steps](/grafast/#unary-steps) in the introduction to remind yourself
that a unary step always represents exactly one value, typically an input to
the GraphQL request (variables, context), a constant, or a derivative thereof.

:::

Some steps may require that certain of their dependencies must be unary, this
means that different values for this step do not need to be factored into
batching, which can significantly simplify the logic. Typically this is used
when the dependency is expected to either be a constant or something provided
via GraphQL field arguments.

If you've received an error pointing to this webpage it is likely because the
step in question has received a normal (non-unary) step where a unary step is
expected. Depending on the reason this has occurred, there are a number of
potential solutions.

## Unary not required

Maybe when writing the step you used `this.addUnaryDependency($step)` by
mistake, and instead you meant the more general `this.addDependency($step)`. If
so, simply fix your typo!

## connection()

The `connection()` step expects `first`, `last`, `offset`, `before` and `after`
to be unary steps &mdash; this is because the GraphQL Cursor Connection
Specification only needs these values to be supplied via GraphQL field
arguments (which are unary) and so requiring them to be unary can simplify the
underlying collection logic. If you're received this error with a
`connection()` step, you're probably using the `connection()` step wrong;
[consider re-reading its
documentation](/grafast/step-library/standard-steps/connection).
