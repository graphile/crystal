### Patch Changes

- [#2305](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2305)
  [`d34014a9a3c469154cc796086ba13719954731e5`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/d34014a9a3c469154cc796086ba13719954731e5)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Plan diagrams now reveal (via
  `@s` code) if a step is meant to be streamed.

- [#2311](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2311)
  [`98516379ac355a0833a64e002f3717cc3a1d6473`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/98516379ac355a0833a64e002f3717cc3a1d6473)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Make `ExecutableStep::getDep`
  generic and add helpers: `maybeGetDep` and `getDepOrConstant`.

- [#2411](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2411)
  [`f8602d05eed3247c90b87c55d7af580d1698effc`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/f8602d05eed3247c90b87c55d7af580d1698effc)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Fix bug in representation of
  `Constant<null>` in plan JSON

- [#2407](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2407)
  [`65df25534fa3f787ba2ab7fd9547d295ff2b1288`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/65df25534fa3f787ba2ab7fd9547d295ff2b1288)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Fixes bug in `__inputObject`
  step where `[key]: undefined` entries could be added. Entries will now only be
  added if not undefined, to match the behavior of GraphQL.js.

- [#2343](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2343)
  [`1b3c76efd27df73eab3a5a1d221ce13de4cd6b1a`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/1b3c76efd27df73eab3a5a1d221ce13de4cd6b1a)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Fix bug in
  operationPlan.cacheStep that didn't respect polymorphic paths.

- [#2330](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2330)
  [`3c0a925f26f10cae627a23c49c75ccd8d76b60c8`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/3c0a925f26f10cae627a23c49c75ccd8d76b60c8)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Unary steps will no longer be
  pushed down in step diagrams. Fix types for connection().

- [#2385](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2385)
  [`fcaeb48844156e258a037f420ea1505edb50c52a`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/fcaeb48844156e258a037f420ea1505edb50c52a)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Improve rendering of mermaid
  diagrams:

  - Don't render dependencies on the `undefined` constant, because it's messy
  - Group when there are multiple dependencies to the same step from the same
    step, and label the line with the count instead.

- [#2324](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2324)
  [`68926abc31c32ce527327ffbb1ede4b0b7be446b`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/68926abc31c32ce527327ffbb1ede4b0b7be446b)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - ðŸš¨ ExecutionValue no longer
  exposes .value and .entries (you need to narrow to access these). Added new
  `.unaryValue()` that can be used to assert the value is unary and retrieve its
  value - this should be used instead of `.at(0)` in general.

- [#2356](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2356)
  [`4b49dbd2df3b339a2ba3f1e9ff400fa1a125298b`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/4b49dbd2df3b339a2ba3f1e9ff400fa1a125298b)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - ðŸš¨ makeGrafastSchema and schema
  export now export extensions directly rather than extensions.grafast - applies
  to fields and arguments. All previous exports cannot be (safely) executed with
  latest makeGrafastSchema - please regenerate exports.

- [#2406](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2406)
  [`d7950e8e28ec6106a4ce2f7fe5e35d88b10eac48`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/d7950e8e28ec6106a4ce2f7fe5e35d88b10eac48)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Fix issues around unary steps
  and polymorphism.

- [#2386](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2386)
  [`c8f1971ea4198633ec97f72f82abf65089f71a88`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/c8f1971ea4198633ec97f72f82abf65089f71a88)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Process connection pagination
  cursors without requiring plantime evaluation of input step values.

- [#2304](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2304)
  [`dd3d22eab73a8554715bf1111e30586251f69a88`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/dd3d22eab73a8554715bf1111e30586251f69a88)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Fix bug where streamed and
  non-streamed steps could be deduplicated; and use a cloned subplan for
  pageInfo calculations.

- [#2315](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2315)
  [`a120a8e43b24dfc174950cdbb69e481272a0b45e`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/a120a8e43b24dfc174950cdbb69e481272a0b45e)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Add more inspect properties to
  inspect() and have constant() simplify 'Object: null prototype'

- [#2326](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2326)
  [`84f06eafa051e907a3050237ac6ee5aefb184652`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/84f06eafa051e907a3050237ac6ee5aefb184652)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Remove `$step.eval*()` from
  cursor pagination pageInfo.

  [`4a3aeaa77c8b8d2e39c1a9d05581d0c613b812cf`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/4a3aeaa77c8b8d2e39c1a9d05581d0c613b812cf)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Add
  `operationPlan().withRootLayerPlan(() => ...)` method to force steps to plan
  in root layer plan (forces them to be unary, ignores side effect steps).

- [#2388](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2388)
  [`0fc2db95d90df918cf5c59ef85f22ac78d8000d3`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/0fc2db95d90df918cf5c59ef85f22ac78d8000d3)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Mark `$step.eval*()` methods as
  internal in preparation for removing them.

- [#2402](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2402)
  [`90e81a5deeae554a8be2dd55dcd01489860e96e6`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/90e81a5deeae554a8be2dd55dcd01489860e96e6)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Allow `mutation` operations to
  complete synchronously (via `grafastSync`) if possible.

  [`c59132eb7a93bc82493d2f1ca050db8aaea9f4d1`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/c59132eb7a93bc82493d2f1ca050db8aaea9f4d1)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Moved calculation of `@stream`
  parameters to runtime, which has meant that stream info is no longer passed at
  planning time - instead execute() can evaluate if it is being streamed or not
  and make decisions based on that.

- [#2377](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2377)
  [`7c38cdeffe034c9b4f5cdd03a8f7f446bd52dcb7`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/7c38cdeffe034c9b4f5cdd03a8f7f446bd52dcb7)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Since `ModifierStep` and
  `BaseStep` are no more; `ExecutableStep` can be renamed to simply `Step`. The
  old name (`ExecutableStep`) is now deprecated.

- [#2340](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2340)
  [`728888b28fcd2a6fc481e0ccdfe20d41181a091f`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/728888b28fcd2a6fc481e0ccdfe20d41181a091f)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Fix bug in handling errors
  inside lists

- [#2406](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2406)
  [`f4f39092d7a51517668384945895d3b450237cce`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/f4f39092d7a51517668384945895d3b450237cce)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - During optimize phase, always
  hoist newly created steps.

- [#2326](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2326)
  [`5cf3dc9d158891eaf324b2cd4f485d1d4bbb6b5e`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/5cf3dc9d158891eaf324b2cd4f485d1d4bbb6b5e)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Export
  `ExecutionValue`/`BatchExecutionValue`/`UnaryExecutionValue` types.

- [#2318](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2318)
  [`83d3b533e702cc875b46ba2ca02bf3642b421be8`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/83d3b533e702cc875b46ba2ca02bf3642b421be8)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Force `constant(...)` steps to
  exist in root layer plan, and implement caching to reduce number of constant
  steps.

- [#2404](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2404)
  [`7001138c38e09822ad13db1018c62d2cac37941e`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/7001138c38e09822ad13db1018c62d2cac37941e)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Be stricter about usage of
  `this.getDep(depId)` vs `this.getDepOptions(depId)`.

- [#2411](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2411)
  [`e9e7e33665e22ec397e9ead054d2e4aad3eadc8c`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/e9e7e33665e22ec397e9ead054d2e4aad3eadc8c)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - When handling lists, only
  deduplicate if a call to `.listItem()` was actually made.

- [#2326](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2326)
  [`bb6ec8d834e3e630e28316196246f514114a2296`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/bb6ec8d834e3e630e28316196246f514114a2296)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - When you
  `this.addUnaryDependency(...)` you may now specify a `nonUnaryMessage` to be
  used if the dependency turns out to not be unary; helping to customise the
  errors to be more useful to the consumer.

- [#2423](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2423)
  [`2b1918d053f590cdc534c8cb81f7e74e96c1bbe6`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/2b1918d053f590cdc534c8cb81f7e74e96c1bbe6)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Ensure all
  variable/argument-related input plans remain in the root layer plan.

- [#2405](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2405)
  [`d1ecb39693a341f85762b27012ec4ea013857b0c`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/d1ecb39693a341f85762b27012ec4ea013857b0c)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Fix a missing deduplicateSteps
  that was causing nullable boundary LayerPlan branching.

  [`042ebafe11fcf7e2ecac9b131265a55dddd42a6d`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/042ebafe11fcf7e2ecac9b131265a55dddd42a6d)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Export `defaultPlanResolver`
  and add `fieldName` to `FieldInfo`.

- [#2356](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2356)
  [`fa005eb0783c58a2476add984fbdd462e0e91dbe`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/fa005eb0783c58a2476add984fbdd462e0e91dbe)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Fix bug in makeGrafastSchema
  that fails to build schema sometimes if a field uses a function shortcut
  rather than object definition.

- [#2411](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2411)
  [`df0e5a0f968cf6f9ae97b68745a9a2f391324bf5`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/df0e5a0f968cf6f9ae97b68745a9a2f391324bf5)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Optimization to grafast's
  internal execution values, which are used heavily in hot paths.

- [#2335](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2335)
  [`ef4cf75acd80e6b9c700c2b5a7ace899e565ef7f`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/ef4cf75acd80e6b9c700c2b5a7ace899e565ef7f)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - stream() method has been
  completely removed and execute() now handles both stream() and defer()
  concerns.

- [#2398](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2398)
  [`c041fd250372c57601188b65a6411c8f440afab6`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/c041fd250372c57601188b65a6411c8f440afab6)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Since the following have been
  removed from Grafast, throw an error if they're seen in the schema:

  - `autoApplyAfterParentInputPlan`
  - `autoApplyAfterParentApplyPlan`
  - `autoApplyAfterParentPlan`
  - `autoApplyAfterParentSubscribePlan`
  - `inputPlan`
  - `applyPlan` on input fields

  Also: when Query type fails to build, throw the underlying error directly.

- [#2424](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2424)
  [`629b45aab49151810f6efc18ac18f7d735626433`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/629b45aab49151810f6efc18ac18f7d735626433)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - makeGrafastSchema format now
  allows for `apply()` functions to be directly provided for input fields and
  enum values, plus `applyPlan()` functions for field arguments. Many places are
  now grafast-centric again with `extensions` as an optional extra field (rather
  than exporting `extensions` directly, which is much less friendly).

- [#2384](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2384)
  [`6d19724330d50d076aab9442660fa8abddd095cb`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/6d19724330d50d076aab9442660fa8abddd095cb)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Move postgresql argument logic
  to runtime (from plantime) to avoid plantime eval of input values.

- [#2335](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2335)
  [`ca5bc1a834df7b894088fb8602a12f9fcff55b38`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/ca5bc1a834df7b894088fb8602a12f9fcff55b38)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - New items() convention method
  allows steps used in list positions to return a _different_ step to actually
  return the list - useful for returning connection-capable steps in list
  positions.

- [#2376](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2376)
  [`da6f3c04efe3d8634c0bc3fcf93ac2518de85322`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/da6f3c04efe3d8634c0bc3fcf93ac2518de85322)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Overhaul Grafast to remove more
  input planning - inputs should be evaluated at runtime - and remove more
  plan-time step evaluation.

  `FieldArgs.get` is no more; use `FieldArgs.getRaw` or use `bakedInput()`
  (TODO: document) to get the "baked" version of a raw input value.

  Input object fields no longer have `applyPlan`/`inputPlan`, instead having the
  runtime equivalents `apply()` and `baked()`. `FieldArgs` is no longer
  available on input object fields, since these fields are no longer called at
  plantime; instead, the actual value is passed.

  `FieldArgs` gains `.typeAt(path)` method that details the GraphQL input type
  at the given path.

  Field arguments are no longer passed `FieldArgs`, instead they're passed a
  (similar) `FieldArg` object representing the argument value itself.

  `autoApplyAfterParentPlan` is no more - instead if an argument has `applyPlan`
  it will be called automatically unless it was called during the field plan
  resolver itself.

  `autoApplyAfterParentSubscribePlan` is no more - instead if an argument has
  `applySubscribePlan` it will be called automatically unless it was called
  during the field plan resolver itself.

  Field arguments no longer support `inputPlan` - use `bakedInput()` if you need
  that.

  Input fields no longer support `inputPlan`, `applyPlan`,
  `autoApplyAfterParentInputPlan` nor `autoApplyAfterParentApplyPlan`. Instead,
  `apply()` (which is called by `applyStep()` at runtime) has been added.

  `sqlValueWithCodec(value, codec)` can be used at runtime in places where
  `$step.placeholder($value, codec)` would have been used previously.
  `placeholder` has been removed from all places that are now runtime - namely
  the list of modifiers below...

  The following `ModifierStep` classes have all dropped their `Step` suffix,
  these `Modifier` classes now all run at runtime, and are thus no longer steps;
  they're invoked as part of the new `applyInput()` (TODO: document) step:

  - `ModifierStep` &rArr; `Modifier`
  - `PgBooleanFilterStep` &rArr; `PgBooleanFilter`
  - `PgClassFilterStep` &rArr; `PgClassFilter`
  - `PgConditionCapableParentStep` &rArr; `PgConditionCapableParent`
  - `PgConditionLikeStep` &rArr; `PgConditionLike`
  - `PgConditionStepMode` &rArr; `PgConditionMode`
  - `PgConditionStep` &rArr; `PgCondition`
  - `PgManyFilterStep` &rArr; `PgManyFilter`
  - `PgOrFilterStep` &rArr; `PgOrFilter`
  - `PgTempTableStep` &rArr; `PgTempTable`
  - `SetterCapableStep` &rArr; `SetterCapable`
  - `SetterStep` &rArr; `Setter`

  (Interestingly, other than the removal of `placeholder` and the fact they deal
  with runtime values rather than steps now, they're very similar to what they
  were before.)

  The deprecated forms of the above have been removed.

  Methods that rely on these modifier plans have been removed:

  - `PgUnionAllStep.wherePlan` - use
    `fieldArg.apply($unionAll, qb => qb.whereBuilder())` instead
  - `PgUnionAllStep.havingPlan` - use
    `fieldArg.apply($unionAll, qb => qb.havingBuilder())` instead
  - Same for PgSelectStep

  The following gain query builders:

  - `PgInsertSingle`
  - `PgUpdateSingle`
  - `PgDeleteSingle`

  Query builders gain `meta`, an object that can be augmented with metadata
  about the operation (typically this relates to cursors and similar
  functionality). This is now used to implement `clientMutationId`.

  Extends query builders with additional functionality.

  Many of the types have had their generics changed, TypeScript should guide you
  if you have issues here.

  `NodeIdHandler` now requires a `getIdentifiers` method that runs at runtime
  and returns the identifiers from a decoded NodeId string.

  Types around GraphQL Global Object Identification (i.e. `Node` / `id`) have
  changed.

  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - ðŸš¨ `connection()` step no
  longer guarantees the incoming step for first/last/before/after/offset are
  InputStep - you must NOT use `$input.eval*()` methods - instead add the values
  as dependencies and evaluate them at runtime like any other step.

### Patch Changes

- [#2071](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2071)
  [`582bd768f`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/582bd768fec403ce3284f293b85b9fd86e4d3f40)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - `GrafastExecutionArgs` now
  accepts `resolvedPreset` and `requestContext` directly; passing these through
  additional arguments is now deprecated and support will be removed in a future
  revision. This affects:

  - `grafast()`
  - `execute()`
  - `subscribe()`
  - `hookArgs()`

  `graphile-config` has gained a middleware system which is more powerful than
  it's AsyncHooks system. Old hooks can be emulated through the middleware
  system safely since middleware is a superset of hooks' capabilities.
  `applyHooks` has been renamed to `orderedApply` (because it applies to more
  than just hooks), calling `applyHooks` will still work but is deprecated.

  ðŸš¨ `grafast` no longer automatically reads your `graphile.config.ts` or
  similar; you must do that yourself and pass the `resolvedPreset` to grafast
  via the `args`. This is to aid in bundling of grafast since it should not need
  to read from filesystem or dynamically load modules.

  `grafast` no longer outputs performance warning when you set
  `GRAPHILE_ENV=development`.

  ðŸš¨ `plugin.grafast.hooks.args` is now `plugin.grafast.middleware.prepareArgs`,
  and the signature has changed - you must be sure to call the `next()` function
  and ctx/resolvedPreset can be extracted directly from `args`:

  ```diff
   const plugin = {
     grafast: {
  -    hooks: {
  +    middleware: {
  -      args({ args, ctx, resolvedPreset }) {
  +      prepareArgs(next, { args }) {
  +        const { requestContext: ctx, resolvedPreset } = args;
           // ...
  +        return next();
         }
       }
     }
   }
  ```

  Many more middleware have been added; use TypeScript's autocomplete to see
  what's available until we have proper documentation for them.

  `plugin.grafserv.hooks.*` are still supported but deprecated; instead use
  middleware `plugin.grafserv.middleware.*` (note that call signatures have
  changed slightly, similar to the diff above):

  - `hooks.init` -> `middleware.setPreset`
  - `hooks.processGraphQLRequestBody` -> `middleware.processGraphQLRequestBody`
  - `hooks.ruruHTMLParts` -> `middleware.ruruHTMLParts`

  A few TypeScript types related to Hooks have been renamed, but their old names
  are still available, just deprecated. They will be removed in a future update:

  - `HookObject` -> `FunctionalityObject`
  - `PluginHook` -> `CallbackOrDescriptor`
  - `PluginHookObject` -> `CallbackDescriptor`
  - `PluginHookCallback` -> `UnwrapCallback`

  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Fix performance issue in
  `loadOne()`/`loadMany()` due to using `setTimeout(cb, 0)`, now using
  `process.nextTick(cb)`. High enough concurrency and the issue goes away, but
  with limited concurrency this causes a lot of `(idle)` in profiling and thus
  completing 10k items took longer. (Lots of time spent in `epoll_pwait`.)

  to pass additional params to `execute()` and `subscribe()` to enable these.

  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Breaking: `connection()` step
  now accepts configuration object in place of 2nd argument onwards:

  ```diff
  -return connection($list, nodePlan, cursorPlan);
  +return connection($list, { nodePlan, cursorPlan });
  ```

  Feature: `edgeDataPlan` can be specified as part of this configuration object,
  allowing you to associate edge data with your connection edges:

  ```ts
  return connection($list, {
    edgeDataPlan($item) {
      return object({ item: $item, otherThing: $otherThing });
    },
  });

  // ...

  const plans = {
    FooEdge: {
      otherThing($edge) {
        return $edge.data().get("otherThing");
      },
    },
  };
  ```

  Feature: `ConnectionStep` and `EdgeStep` gain `get()` methods, so
  `*Connection.edges`, `*Connection.nodes`, `*Connection.pageInfo`, `*Edge.node`
  and `*Edge.cursor` no longer need plans to be defined.

  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Add 'unary steps' concept to
  codebase and refactor to using new executeV2 execution method which leverages
  them. Backwards compatibility maintained, but users should move to executeV2.

  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - ðŸš¨ TypeScript is now configured
  to hide interfaces marked as `@internal`. This may result in a few errors
  where you're accessing things you oughtn't be, but also may hide some
  interfaces that should be exposed - please file an issue if an API you were
  dependent on has been removed from the TypeScript typings. If that API happens
  to be `step.dependencies`; you should first read this:

  [`1fe47a2b0`](https://github.com/benjie/crystal/commit/1fe47a2b08d6e7153a22dde3a99b7a9bf50c4f84)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - **MAJOR BREAKING CHANGE**:
  implicit application of args/input fields has been removed.

  Previously we would track the fieldArgs that you accessed (via `.get()`,
  `.getRaw()` or `.apply()`) and those that you _did not access_ would
  automatically have their `applyPlan` called, if they had one. This isn't
  likely to be particularly useful for pure Gra*fast* users (unless they want to
  adopt this pattern) but it's extremely useful for plugin-based schemas as it
  allows plugins to add arguments that can influence their field's plan _without
  having to wrap the field's plan resolver function_. This is fairly critical,
  otherwise each behavior added (`first:`, `condition:`, `orderBy:`, `filter:`,
  `ignoreArchived:`, etc etc) would wrap the plan resolver with another function
  layer, and they would get _messy_.

  However, implicit is rarely good. And it turns out that it severely limited
  what I wanted to do for improving the `fieldArgs` APIs.

  I decided to remove this implicit functionality by making it more explicit, so
  now args/input fields can specify the relevant
  `autoApplyAfterParent{Plan,SubscribePlan,InputPlan,ApplyPlan}: true` property
  and we'll only apply them at a single level.

  From a user perspective, little has changed. From a plugin author perspective,
  if you were relying on the implicit `applyPlan` then you should now add the
  relevant `autoApply*` property next to your `applyPlan` method.

  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Massive overhaul of planning,

  - `RemapKeys` can optimize itself away if it doesn't really do anything

    paths"
  - `deduplicate()` will now no-longer receive the step itself as a peer

  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Various optimizations of the
  Gra*fast* plan by converting things to constants where possible.

  - `Step.optimize()` is now passed a `meta` object if the step sets
    `optimizeMetaKey`; this object can store planning-only values and share
    across a step family.
  - `__InputStaticLeafStep` now optimizes down to a constant
  - `ListStep` where every entry in the list is a constant is now automatically
    replaced with a `ConstantStep` representing the final list
  - `ObjectStep` where all the values are `ConstantStep` is now replaced with a
    `ConstantStep`
  - `ConstantStep` can now deduplicate with other constant steps with the exact
    same value
  - `OperationPlan.optimizeStep()` now also re-deduplicates the step if it
    supports multiple optimizations
  - `ConstantStep` now has `toStringMeta` to represent the constant value in the
    plan diagram
  - When each step is processed (but not by deduplicate) we'll automatically try
    and deduplicate any new steps created

  `loadOne`/`loadMany` are still used exactly as before, but some of the related

  class as an item from a `loadMany` (`LoadedRecordStep`).

  References to `LoadOneStep` and `LoadManySingleRecordStep` both need to be
  replaced with `LoadedRecordStep`.

  References to `LoadManyStep` need to be replaced with `LoadStep`.

  `LoadOneOptions` and `LoadManyOptions` are now both `LoadOptions` (and types

  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - The Grafast step class
  'execute' and 'stream' methods now have a new additional first argument
  `count` which indicates how many results they must return. This means we don't
  need to rely on the `values[0].length` trick to determine how many results to
  return, and thus we can pass through an empty tuple to steps that have no
  dependencies.

  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - PgClassSinglePlan is now
  enforced, users will be informed if plans return a step incompatible with the
  given GraphQL object type.

  want them for debugging.

### Patch Changes

- [#229](https://github.com/benjie/crystal/pull/229)
  [`f5a04cf66`](https://github.com/benjie/crystal/commit/f5a04cf66f220c11a6a82db8c1a78b1d91606faa)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - ðŸš¨ **BREAKING CHANGE**
  `hookArgs()` now accepts arguments in the same order as `grafast()`:
  `hookArgs(args, resolvedPreset, ctx)`. Please update all your `hookArgs`
  calls.

## 0.0.1-0.20

### Patch Changes

- [`aac8732f9`](undefined) - Make item callback optional in listen() step.

## 0.0.1-0.19

- [#225](https://github.com/benjie/crystal/pull/225)
  [`397e8bb40`](https://github.com/benjie/crystal/commit/397e8bb40fe3783995172356a39ab7cb33e3bd36)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Gra*fast* will no longer hoist
  steps into a mutationField layer plan making it safer to mutate `context` and
  similar things during a mutation.

## 0.0.1-0.18

### Patch Changes

- [#223](https://github.com/benjie/crystal/pull/223)
  [`4c2b7d1ca`](https://github.com/benjie/crystal/commit/4c2b7d1ca1afbda1e47da22c346cc3b03d01b7f0)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - In addition to `GraphQLArgs`,
  `grafast` now accepts `resolvedPreset` and `requestContext`; if both of these
  are set then `grafast` will perform `hookArgs` for you, this makes running
  tests a lot less boiler-plate-y (you no longer need to
  `parse`/`validate`/`execute` - just `grafast`).

- [#224](https://github.com/benjie/crystal/pull/224)
  [`c8a56cdc8`](https://github.com/benjie/crystal/commit/c8a56cdc83390e5735beb9b90f004e7975cab28c)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - FieldArgs.apply can now accept
  a callback so each list entry can have its own step (solves the OR vs AND
  issue in postgraphile-plugin-connection-filter).

  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Grafserv now masks untrusted
  errors by default; trusted errors are constructed via GraphQL's GraphQLError
  or Grafast's SafeError.

  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Allow subscriptions to come
  from async generator functions (previous detection of this was broken, only
  our manual async iterator objects were working).

  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - ðŸš¨ Breaking changes around
  types and postgres configuration:

  - `GraphileBuild.GraphileResolverContext` renamed to `Grafast.Context`
  - `GraphileConfig.GraphQLRequestContext` renamed to `Grafast.RequestContext`
  - `Grafast.PgDatabaseAdaptorOptions` renaed to
    `GraphileConfig.PgDatabaseAdaptorOptions`
  - `@dataplan/pg/adaptors/node-postgres` is now `@dataplan/pg/adaptors/pg` due
    to the bizarre naming of PostgreSQL clients on npm - we've decided to use
    the module name as the unique identifier
  - `makePgConfigs`:
    - is now `makePgConfig` (singular) - so you'll need to wrap it in an array
      where you use it
    - no longer exported by `@dataplan/pg` (because it depended on `pg`) -
      instead each adaptor exposes this helper - so import from
      `@dataplan/pg/adaptors/node-postgres`
    - accepts an object parameter containing
      `{connectionString, schemas, superuserConnectionString}`, rather than
      multiple string parameters
  - `makeNodePostgresWithPgClient` -> `makePgAdaptorWithPgClient`
  - `postgraphile` CLI will now try and respect the adaptor stated in your
    preset when overriding connection arguments
  - Removed `Grafast.RequestContext.httpRequest` and instead use
    `Grafast.RequestContext.node.req/res`; all server adaptors should implement
    this if appropriate
