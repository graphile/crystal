  `MiddlewareHandlers<TActivities>` type to help with adding middleware to
  configs

  [`b167bd849`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/b167bd8499be5866b71bac6594d55bd768fda1d0)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - ðŸš¨ `{}` is no longer a valid
  `GraphileConfig.ResolvedPreset`; use `resolvePreset({})`

  Also: adds `resolvePreset(preset)` and deprecates `resolvePresets(presets)`.

- [#2250](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2250)
  [`6a13ecbd4`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/6a13ecbd45534c39c846c1d8bc58242108426dd1)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Add support for 'preset.lib'
  which can be used to store global module references to help avoid the dual
  package hazard.

## 0.0.1-beta.10

### Patch Changes

- [#2188](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2188)
  [`cc0941731`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/cc0941731a1679bc04ce7b7fd4254009bb5f1f62)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Overhaul the way in which
  `graphile-config` presets work such that including a preset at two different
  layers shouldn't result in unexpected behavior.

- [#2155](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2155)
  [`8b472cd51`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/8b472cd51cd66d8227f9f2722d09c0a774792b0f)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - `disablePlugins` now supports
  TypeScript auto-completion of known plugin names. Other names are still
  accepted without error, so this is just a minor DX improvement rather than
  type safety.

- [#2160](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2160)
  [`9cd9bb522`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/9cd9bb5222a9f0398ee4b8bfa4f741b6de2a2192)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Add support for lists of hook
  objects, so that the same hook can be applied multiple times in the same
  plugin but with different priorities.

## 0.0.1-beta.9

### Patch Changes

- [#2071](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/pull/2071)
  [`582bd768f`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/commit/582bd768fec403ce3284f293b85b9fd86e4d3f40)
  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - `GrafastExecutionArgs` now
  accepts `resolvedPreset` and `requestContext` directly; passing these through
  additional arguments is now deprecated and support will be removed in a future
  revision. This affects:

  - `grafast()`
  - `execute()`
  - `subscribe()`
  - `hookArgs()`

  `graphile-config` has gained a middleware system which is more powerful than
  it's AsyncHooks system. Old hooks can be emulated through the middleware
  system safely since middleware is a superset of hooks' capabilities.
  `applyHooks` has been renamed to `orderedApply` (because it applies to more
  than just hooks), calling `applyHooks` will still work but is deprecated.

  ðŸš¨ `grafast` no longer automatically reads your `graphile.config.ts` or
  similar; you must do that yourself and pass the `resolvedPreset` to grafast
  via the `args`. This is to aid in bundling of grafast since it should not need
  to read from filesystem or dynamically load modules.

  `grafast` no longer outputs performance warning when you set
  `GRAPHILE_ENV=development`.

  ðŸš¨ `plugin.grafast.hooks.args` is now `plugin.grafast.middleware.prepareArgs`,
  and the signature has changed - you must be sure to call the `next()` function
  and ctx/resolvedPreset can be extracted directly from `args`:

  ```diff
   const plugin = {
     grafast: {
  -    hooks: {
  +    middleware: {
  -      args({ args, ctx, resolvedPreset }) {
  +      prepareArgs(next, { args }) {
  +        const { requestContext: ctx, resolvedPreset } = args;
           // ...
  +        return next();
         }
       }
     }
   }
  ```

  Many more middleware have been added; use TypeScript's autocomplete to see
  what's available until we have proper documentation for them.

  `plugin.grafserv.hooks.*` are still supported but deprecated; instead use
  middleware `plugin.grafserv.middleware.*` (note that call signatures have
  changed slightly, similar to the diff above):

  - `hooks.init` -> `middleware.setPreset`
  - `hooks.processGraphQLRequestBody` -> `middleware.processGraphQLRequestBody`
  - `hooks.ruruHTMLParts` -> `middleware.ruruHTMLParts`

  A few TypeScript types related to Hooks have been renamed, but their old names
  are still available, just deprecated. They will be removed in a future update:

  - `HookObject` -> `FunctionalityObject`
  - `PluginHook` -> `CallbackOrDescriptor`
  - `PluginHookObject` -> `CallbackDescriptor`
  - `PluginHookCallback` -> `UnwrapCallback`

  Thanks [@benjie](https://github.com/benjie)! - Fix plugin ordering bug that
