## About PostGraphile V5

**Production-ready** and already powering many apps, V5 is a complete ground-up
rewrite powered by [Gra*fast*](https://grafast.org), our cutting-edge planning
and execution engine for GraphQL. It dramatically reduces Postgres load,
supports true polymorphism, and introduces incremental delivery, executable
schema exports, greater control over your schema, and much more. Its efficient
and ergonomic extensibility guides you into the pit of success. It even
introduces an “eject button” for when you feel the need to move beyond an
autogenerated schema!

V5 remains in “beta” while we finalize the APIs, so minor adjustments may
be needed between updates. Postgres-centric users who leverage [trusted
documents](https://benjie.dev/graphql/trusted-documents) (highly recommended!)
should experience particularly smooth sailing!

- [V5 Documentation](/postgraphile/5)
- [V4 &rarr; V5 migration guide](/postgraphile/5/migrating-from-v4)

## Current Status

Now that all four epics are complete, all that remains is fixing the types, smoothing the edges,
tracking down and adding tests for all the edge cases, adding documentation
and a final review of the exposed APIs. Much of this you can help with!

## How to help

To aid us in reaching the release candidate stage faster, you can:

- Try V5 out on your real use cases and report back
  - Try in production, or just on a test branch
  - Send us feedback &mdash; **good &amp; bad** &mdash; through [GitHub](https://github.com/graphile/crystal) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/graphile)
  - Use [benjie/ouch-my-finger](https://github.com/benjie/ouch-my-finger) to generate minimal reproductions
- Help address issues in the [V5 Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/graphile/projects/3)
- Contribute to documentation and examples
- [Sponsor us](https://graphile.org/sponsor) &mdash; **you rely on our software, we rely on your financial support**

## Epics - COMPLETE!

With the help of the community, we identified four major issues in our new
planning engine, Gra*fast*. These issues related to ergonomics, edge cases, or efficiency;
they all required changes to user code (“plan resolvers”), so addressing
them before release was vital.

Since fixing these issues required fundamental changes to the way the system
works &mdash; re-architectures that took many months to complete &mdash; we called them
“epics”. All four are now complete, hurrah!

- ✅ Global dependencies (solved via “unary” steps that represent exactly one value)
- ✅ Early exit (solved via value “flags” tracking when a value should inhibit dependents)
- ✅ Stop branching due to planning of nested input values (aka [remove `$step.eval*()`](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/issues/2060))
- ✅ Avoid excessive polymorphic branching (achieved June 2025)

## Milestone releases

Some of the more notable recent releases are listed below. [Graphile sponsors](https://graphile.org/sponsor) have access to release notes through our community support channels.
Everyone else can see some detail in the PostGraphile [changelog](https://github.com/graphile/crystal/blob/main/postgraphile/postgraphile/CHANGELOG.md).
