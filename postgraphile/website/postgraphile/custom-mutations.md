title: Custom Mutations
---

PostGraphile automatically generates [CRUD Mutations](./crud-mutations) for
you; but it’s rare that these will cover all your needs — and many people just
disable them outright. Custom mutations enable you to write exactly the business
logic you need with access to all of your data all wrapped up in a PostgreSQL
function. You can even bypass the RLS and GRANT checks, should you so choose, by
tagging your function as `SECURITY DEFINER` — but be very careful when you do
so!

### Rules

To create a function that PostGraphile will recognise as a custom mutation, it
must obey the following rules:

- adhere to
  [common PostGraphile function restrictions](./function-restrictions)
- must be marked as `VOLATILE` (which is the default for PostgreSQL functions)
- must be defined in one of the introspected schemas

Functions matching these requirements will be represented in GraphQL in a way
that is compatible with the
[Relay Input Object Mutations Specification](https://relay.dev/docs/en/mutations).
For example the function

```sql
create function my_function(a int, b int) returns text as $$ … $$ language sql volatile;
```

could be called from GraphQL like this:

```graphql {2}
mutation {
  myFunction(input: { a: 1, b: 2 }) {
    text
  }
}
```

Look at the documentation in Ruru/Graph*i*QL to find the parameters you may use.

### Example

Here’s an example of a custom mutation, which will generate the GraphQL
`acceptTeamInvite` mutation:

```sql
create function app_public.accept_team_invite(team_id integer)
returns app_public.team_members
as $$
  update app_public.team_members
    set accepted_at = now()
    where accepted_at is null
    and team_members.team_id = accept_team_invite.team_id
    and member_id = app_public.current_user_id()
    returning *;
$$ language sql volatile strict security definer;
```

Notes on the above function:

- `STRICT` is optional, it means that if any of the arguments are null then the
  mutation will not be called (and will thus return null with no error) - this
  allows us to mark `teamId` as a required argument.
- `SECURITY INVOKER` is the default, it means the function will run with the
  _security_ of the person who _invoked_ the function
- `SECURITY DEFINER` means that the function will run with the _security_ of the
  person who _defined_ the function, typically the database owner - this means
  that the function may bypass RLS, RBAC and other security concerns. Be careful
  when using `SECURITY DEFINER` - think of it like `sudo`!
- we use `LANGUAGE sql` here, but you can use `LANGUAGE plpgsql` if you need
  variables or looping or if blocks or similar concerns; or if you want to write
  in a more familiar language you can use `LANGUAGE plv8` (JavaScript, requires
  extension), or one of the built in `LANGUAGE` options such as Python, Perl or
  Tcl

### pgStrictFunctions

If you’d like PostGraphile to treat all function arguments as required
(non-null) unless they have a default then you can use the
`preset.gather.pgStrictFunctions` setting:

```js title="graphile.config.mjs"
export default {
  // ...
  gather: {
    pgStrictFunctions: true,
  },
};
```

This is similar to marking the function as `STRICT` but with the subtle
difference that arguments with defaults may be specified as `NULL` without
necessitating that the function returns null. With this setting enabled,
arguments without default value will be set mandatory while arguments with
default value will be optional. For example: `create function foo(a int, b int,
c int = 0, d int = null)...` would give a mutation `foo(a: Int!, b: Int!, c:
Int, d: Int)`.

### Bulk Insert Example

Here’s an example of a custom mutation that performs a “bulk insert” — inserting
and returning a set of records:

```sql
create function app_public.create_documents(num integer, type text, location text)
returns setof app_public.document
as $$
  insert into app_public.document (type, location)
    select create_documents.type, create_documents.location
    from generate_series(1, num) i
    returning *;
$$ language sql strict volatile;
```

### Graphile Plugins

If you prefer adding mutations on the JavaScript side, you can use
`ExtendSchemaPlugin` from `graphile-utils`; see [Schema
Plugins](./extending) for more information.

### GraphQL Schema Stitching

You can also stitch multiple GraphQL schemas together, you can read more about
doing this with PostGraphile here: [Authenticated and Stitched Schemas with
PostGraphile, Passport and
Stripe](https://medium.com/@sastraxi/authenticated-and-stitched-schemas-with-postgraphile-passport-and-stripe-a51490a858a2).
