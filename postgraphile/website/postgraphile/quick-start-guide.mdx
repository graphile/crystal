This quick start guide will walk you through spinning up your first PostGraphile
server, including installing the prerequisites such as Node and PostgreSQL.

### Install Node

You need to be running Node.js v8.6 or higher to run PostGraphile. You can check
your current version of Node by running `node --version`. If you're running a
recent version you can skip this section.

There's many ways of installing node; if you're on macOS you might prefer
installing with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) via `brew install node`; if you're
on a unix-based system you might like to
[use the `nvm` tool](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). Failing these, if
you're using OS X or Windows, use one of the installers from the
[Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Make sure you select
the version labelled LTS. Linux users can scroll down the page and find the
version that works with their system.

Once installed run `node -v` in a terminal to check your version. It must be
16.20.0 or higher.

### Install PostgreSQL

We need a PostgreSQL database to connect to. You can skip this section if you
already have PostgreSQL version `11.0` or higher installed. If you do not use a
local PostgreSQL server then you'll need to modify the commands that follow to
account for this.

:::tip

PostgreSQL does not need to be installed on the same machine, but you'll have a
better development experience if it is. Try and minimise database connection
latency — do not use a database on the other side of the planet from you!

:::

If you are running on macOS, it is recommended that you install and use
[PostgreSQL.app](http://postgresapp.com/). If you are on another platform, go to
the [PostgreSQL download page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) to pick up
a copy of PostgreSQL. The latest LTS version is probably a good choice, but please
refer to [the requirements documentation](./requirements).

After that, make sure your copy of PostgreSQL is running locally by running
`psql postgres:///` in a terminal (the three slashes is deliberate — we're
deliberately not specifying a host so it uses the defaults (either a unix
socket or hostname: localhost, port: 5432).

If you get something like this returned then PostgreSQL is successfully
installed:

```bash
$ psql "postgres:///"

psql: FATAL:  database "username" does not exist
```

however, if you receive a "Connection refused" error then that indicates your
PostgreSQL server is not running, or not reachable:

```bash
$ psql "postgres:///"

psql: could not connect to server: Connection refused
```

If you want to connect to a different database within PostgreSQL, just add the
database name to the end of the connection string:

```bash
$ psql postgres:///testdb # Connects to the `testdb` database on your local machine
$ psql "postgres://user:password@somehost:2345/somedb"  # Connects to the `somedb` database at `postgres://somehost:2345` using login with `user` and `password`
```

Read the documentation on
[PostgreSQL connection strings](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING)
to learn more about alternative formats (including using a password).

### Create a Database

Next, create a database. You can do this by using the terminal:

```
$ createdb mydb
```

This will create a PostgreSQL database called "mydb". You can read more about
this on the
[PostgreSQL Documentation site](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/tutorial-createdb.html).
Now you can run `psql` with your database URL and get a SQL prompt:

```bash
$ psql "postgres:///mydb"
psql (14.*)
Type "help" for help.

=#
```

Run the following query to make sure things are working smoothly:

```
=# select 1 + 1 as two;
 two
-----
   2
(1 row)

=#
```

### Install PostGraphile

Use your package manager of choice to install the `postgraphile` module:
[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node):

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save postgraphile@beta
```

:::tip

We do not recommend installing PostGraphile globally (e.g. with the `-g` flag
to `npm`) — local installs are preferred. Though it may seem simpler to use
global installs at first, it will become more complicated and give you hard to
debug errors, so even if you're new to Node we suggest you get used to local
installs.

:::

### Running PostGraphile

To run PostGraphile, since we've installed `postgraphile` locally, we need to
use the `npx` command (or `yarn` if you prefer) so that the system can find the
local binary. We then pass a standard preset, and the same URL that you used
for `psql` with the database name added:

```bash npm2yarn
# Connect to the `mydb` database within the local PostgreSQL server
$ npx postgraphile -P postgraphile/presets/amber -c "postgres:///mydb"

# Connect to a database that requires SSL/TLS
$ npx postgraphile -P postgraphile/presets/amber -c "postgres://securehost:5432/db?ssl=true"

# Connect to the `somedb` database within the PostgreSQL at somehost port 2345
$ npx postgraphile -P postgraphile/presets/amber -c "postgres://somehost:2345/somedb"
```

You can also run PostGraphile with the watch flag:

```bash npm2yarn
$ npx postgraphile -P postgraphile/presets/amber -c "postgres:///mydb" --watch
```

With the `--watch` flag, PostGraphile will automatically update your GraphQL API
whenever the PostgreSQL schemas you are introspecting change.

### Configuring PostGraphile

Having to enter all these flags each time can become cumbersome, so we'll
create a `graphile.config.mjs` file to store our configuration.

A minimal config so you just don't need the `-P postgraphile/presets/amber` would be be:

```js title="graphile.config.mjs"
import { PostGraphileAmberPreset } from "postgraphile/presets/amber";
export default { extends: [PostGraphileAmberPreset] };
```

An configuration equivalent to the CLI with the watch flag above would be:

```js title="graphile.config.mjs"
import { PostGraphileAmberPreset } from "postgraphile/presets/amber";
import { makePgService } from "postgraphile/adaptors/pg";

/** @type {GraphileConfig.Preset} */
const preset = {
  extends: [PostGraphileAmberPreset],
  pgServices: [makePgService({ connectionString: "postgres:///mydb" })],
  grafserv: { watch: true },
};

export default preset;
```

(Read more about `graphile.config.mjs`, including how to write it in
TypeScript, in the [Configuration documentation](./config.mdx).)

With this configuration in place, we no longer need to pass the flags, so we
can just run PostGraphile as:

```bash npm2yarn
$ npx postgraphile
```

### Writing GraphQL Queries

Running PostGraphile will give you a URL:

```
Server listening on port 5678 at http://127.0.0.1:5678/graphql
```

You can visit this URL in your web browser to see the
[Ruru](https://grafast.org/ruru) (a Gra*fast* flavoured
[GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) IDE) interface, or you can
issue GraphQL requests to this URL using a GraphQL client of your choosing.

Well done — you've got PostGraphile up and running!
