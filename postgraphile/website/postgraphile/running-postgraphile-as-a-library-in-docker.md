title: Running PostGraphile as a library in Docker
---

:::caution

This documentation is copied from Version 4 and has not been updated to Version
5 yet; it may not be valid.

:::

The following guide describes how to run a network of Docker containers on a
local machine, including one container for a PostgreSQL database and one
container running PostGraphile.

It is following the same use case as the guide
**[Running PostGraphile in Docker](./running-postgraphile-in-docker)** with one
difference, the PostGraphile container runs a **Node.js application using
PostGraphile as library** instead of running PostGraphile via CLI. Running
PostGraphile as a library opens doors to greater customization possibilities.

Follow the steps provided in the guide
**[Running PostGraphile in Docker](./running-postgraphile-in-docker)** and come
back to this guide to create the GraphQL container.

## Create PostGraphile Container

At this stage, the repository should look like this:

```
/
├─ db/
|  ├─ init/
|  |  ├─ 00-database.sql
|  |  └─ 01-data.sql
|  └─ Dockerfile
├─ .env
└─ docker-compose.yml
```

### Update Environment Variables

Update the file `.env` to add the `PORT` and `DATABASE_URL` which will be used
by PostGraphile to connect to the PostgreSQL database. Note the `DATABASE_URL`
follows the syntax `postgres://<user>:<password>@db:5432/<db_name>`.

```ini
[...]
# GRAPHQL
# Parameters used by graphql container
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:change_me@db:5432/forum_example
PORT=5433
```

### Create Node.js Application

Create a new folder `graphql` at the root of the repository. It will be used to
store the files necessary to create the PostGraphile container. In the `graphql`
folder, create a subfolder `src` and add a file `package.json` into it with the
following content.

```json
{
  "name": "postgraphile-as-library",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "PostGraphile as a library in a dockerized Node.js application.",
  "author": "Alexis ROLLAND",
  "license": "Apache-2.0",
  "main": "server.js",
  "keywords": ["nodejs", "postgraphile"],
  "dependencies": {
    "postgraphile": "^4.5.5",
    "postgraphile-plugin-connection-filter": "^1.1.3"
  }
}
```

This file will be used by NPM package manager to install the dependencies in the
Node.js container. In particular `postgraphile` and the excellent plugin
`postgraphile-plugin-connection-filter`.

In the same `src` folder, create a new file `server.js` with the following
content.

```js
const http = require("http");
const { postgraphile } = require("postgraphile");

http
  .createServer(
    postgraphile(process.env.DATABASE_URL, "public", {
      watchPg: true,
      graphiql: true,
      enhanceGraphiql: true,
    }),
  )
  .listen(process.env.PORT);
```

### Create PostGraphile Dockerfile

Create a new file `Dockerfile` in the `graphql` folder (not in the folder `src`)
with the following content.

```dockerfile
FROM node:alpine
LABEL description="Instant high-performance GraphQL API for your PostgreSQL database https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile"

# Set Node.js app folder
RUN mkdir -p /home/node/app/node_modules
WORKDIR /home/node/app

# Copy dependencies
COPY ./src/package*.json .
RUN chown -R node:node /home/node/app

# Install dependencies
USER node
RUN npm install

# Copy application files
COPY --chown=node:node ./src .

EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "node", "server.js" ]
```

### Update Docker Compose File

Update the file `docker-compose.yml` under the `services` section to include the
GraphQL service.

```yml
version: "3.3"
services:
    db: [...]

    graphql:
        container_name: forum-example-graphql
        restart: always
        image: forum-example-graphql
        build:
            context: ./graphql
        env_file:
            - ./.env
        depends_on:
            - db
        networks:
            - network
        ports:
            - 5433:5433
[...]
```

At this stage, the repository should look like this:

```
/
├─ db/
|  ├─ init/
|  |  ├─ 00-database.sql
|  |  └─ 01-data.sql
|  └─ Dockerfile
├─ graphql/
|  ├─ src/
|  |  ├─ package.json
|  |  └─ server.js
|  └─ Dockerfile
├─ .env
└─ docker-compose.yml
```

## Build Images And Run Containers

### Build Images

You can build the Docker images by executing the following command from the root
of the repository.

```shell
# Build images for all services in docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose build

# You can also build images one by one
# For instance you can build the database image like this
$ docker-compose build db

# And build the graphql image like this
$ docker-compose build graphql
```

### Run Containers

You can run the Docker containers by executing the following command from the
root of the repository. Note when running the database container for the first
time, Docker will automatically create a Docker Volume to persist the data from
the database. The Docker Volume is automatically named as
`<your_repository_name>_db`.

```shell
# Run containers for all services in docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose up

# Run containers as daemon (in background)
$ docker-compose up -d

# Run only the database container as daemon
$ docker-compose up -d db

# Run only the GraphQL container as daemon
$ docker-compose up -d graphql
```

Each container can be accessed at the following addresses. Note if you run
Docker Toolbox on Windows Home, you can get your Docker machine IP address with
the command `$ docker-machine ip default`.

| Container                 | Docker on Linux / Windows Pro    | Docker on Windows Home                        |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| GraphQL API Documentation | `http://localhost:5433/graphiql` | `http://your_docker_machine_ip:5433/graphiql` |
| GraphQL API               | `http://localhost:5433/graphql`  | `http://your_docker_machine_ip:5433/graphql`  |
| PostgreSQL Database       | host: `localhost`, port: `5432`  | host: `your_docker_machine_ip`, port: `5432`  |

### Re-initialize The Database

In case you do changes to the database schema by modifying the files in
`/db/init`, you will need to re-initialize the database to see these changes.
This means you need to delete the Docker Volume, the database Docker Image and
rebuild it.

```shell
# Stop running containers
$ docker-compose down

# List Docker volumes
$ docker volume ls

# Delete volume
$ docker volume rm <your_repository_name>_db

# Delete database image to force rebuild
$ docker rmi db

# Run containers (will automatically rebuild the image)
$ docker-compose up
```
