:::warning[Not yet available in PostGraphile V5]

Live queries are **not yet supported** in PostGraphile V5. The V4 implementation
was highly experimental and had significant issues. Gra*fast* should allow a
much more powerful, performant, and stable implementation, but it has not been
built yet.

If you want live queries in V5, please sponsor the feature or reach out to work
on it together.

:::

<div className={styles.intro}>

A “live query” monitors the query a user provides and gives the client an
updated version whenever the query would return a different result.

</div>

## Status

Live queries are planned for a future PostGraphile V5 release. For now, use
standard GraphQL subscriptions for real-time updates. The [Real-time
features](./realtime.md) page covers the subscription options currently
available.
