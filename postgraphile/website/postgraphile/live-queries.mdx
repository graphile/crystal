<div className={styles.intro}>

A “live query” monitors the query a user provides and gives the client an
updated version whenever the query would return a different result.

</div>

## Status

Live queries are planned for a future PostGraphile V5 release. For now, use
standard GraphQL subscriptions for real-time updates. The [Real-time
features](./realtime.md) page covers the subscription options currently
available.

:::note[Subscriptions should generally be preferred over live queries]

Subscriptions work on an event basis and are very scalable for that reason -
look into pubsub scalability. They're also expressive, and can tell you things
that your data might not - for example "Benjie is typing..." might not be a
state that you store permanently to the database, but is is a reasonable event.

Live queries on the other hand require a reactive datastore (or polling) to try
and keep a particular query up to date whenever something under the query might
cause it to change. It's very hard to achieve especially when combining multiple
data sources, and is often a lot "noisier" on the network. There is not yet a
GraphQL standard for live queries.

The PostGraphile V4 implementation of live queries was highly experimental and
had significant issues. Gra*fast* should allow a much more powerful, performant,
and stable implementation, but it has not been built yet. If you want live
queries in V5, please sponsor the feature or reach out to work on it together.
