# View Configuration Options

Sponsors have access to the `graphile` CLI tool which can be used to view both
the available options, and also your resolved configuration.

## Viewing the available options

Once you have a basic configuration file, you can use the <Spon /> `graphile` CLI to
find out what options are available to you:

```shell
graphile config options
```

:::info[The graphile CLI is a development aid]

The `graphile` CLI is a development aid only, and is not needed at runtime or
in production (or in development really, it’s just a handy little helper). This
utility is sponsors-only source-available software. If you’re not a sponsor
there’s a 30 day free trial that starts as soon as you run it for the first
time. You may sponsor at any level for access to this utility. Read the details
in the [graphile command’s
README](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphile/v/alpha).

:::

Note that the options available will be influenced by the modules that you are
using, so be sure to import any plugins and presets at the top of your config
file.

## Viewing the resolved configuration

You can also use the <Spon /> `graphile` CLI to print out your resolved configuration
(once all the presets have been applied). This can help with debugging:

```shell
graphile config print
```
