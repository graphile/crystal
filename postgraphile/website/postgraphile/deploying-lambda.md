title: Deploying to AWS Lambda
---

PostGraphile V5 can run on AWS Lambda via the Grafserv Lambda adaptor
(`postgraphile/grafserv/lambda/v1`). We
strongly recommend you [export your schema as executable
code](./exporting-schema.md) so that startup time is minimized.

Please ask for help [via the discord](https://discord.gg/graphile) (or GitHub
issues) and submit improvements to this page if/when you get it working.
