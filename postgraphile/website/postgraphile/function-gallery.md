Below you'll find some examples of various PostgreSQL functions, and their
effects on PostGraphile.

## Custom Queries

### Logged in user field

```sql
create function viewer()
returns users
as $$
  select *
  from users
  where id = current_user_id();
  /*
   * current_user_id() is a function
   * that returns the logged in user's
   * id, e.g. by extracting from the JWT
   * or indicated via pgSettings.
   */

## Custom Mutations

### Insert multiple records

```sql
/**
 * Occasionally you'll want to create a bunch of rows in different tables in a
 * single mutation. Here's an example of how to do that.
 *
 * Pretend we're registering quiz entries, and we want to store each answer in
 * its own table as we want to be able to operate on the answers independently
 * later.
 *
 * This means we want:
 *
 *  1. A mutation that takes input data for inserting one quiz entry and
 *  multiple answers.
 *  2. A function that inserts a new quiz entry, inserts an answer for each
 *  answer provided in the input data, and connects each answer to the created
 *  quiz entry.
 *  3. Finally, we want the function to return the inserted quiz entry itself.
