<div className={styles.intro}>

In the first Gra<em>fast</em> Working Group, we outlined 4 <em>major</em> issues in Gra<em>fast</em>
that needed to be addressed before we could think about general release. With
this release, 3 of these are now complete!

- ✅⤵️ Global dependencies - solved via "unary" steps
- ✅⤵️ Early exit - solved via "flags"
- ✅🎉 **Eradicating eval - this release!**
- 🤔🔜 Polymorphism

We’re proud to announce that the third of these, eradicating eval, is now
addressed with the launch of `grafast@0.1.1-beta.21`, and the approach has been
fully adopted and tested via incorporation into `postgraphile@5.0.0-beta.40`.

## What does this mean for PostGraphile?

Gra*fast* is a cutting-edge GraphQL planning and execution engine that leverages
the declarative nature of GraphQL to execute your requests with maximal
efficiency no matter the data sources you're working with. PostGraphile V5 uses
Gra*fast* as the underlying execution engine, allowing it to build much more
efficient SQL queries than PostGraphile V4 could achieve whilst also
significantly expanding the capabilities of the system - not to mention solving
some longstanding issues!

Whilst users of PostGraphile are not required to deeply understand the internals
of Gra*fast*, this focus of eradicating `$step.eval*()` methods from Gra*fast*
has given PostGraphile users some new benefits.

### SQL generation moved to runtime

PostGraphile's various SQL-running steps like PgSelectStep now build their
queries at runtime rather than plan-time. They use the "builder" pattern, where
much of the SQL query can be established at plan-time, but final tweaks can be
applied at run-time (register tweaks via the `$pgSelect.apply($callback)`
method) before the query is built.

### SQL efficiency increased

Since we have more information at run-time, our SQL queries were able to become
even simpler, 10% smaller on average across our test suite! This nets us a
modest performance improvement inside PostgreSQL, but the shift to runtime does
cost us a little performance in the JS layer since queries now need to be built
for every request, rather than once per plan. We're happy with this tradeoff;
one of the core goals of PostGraphile V5 (and the motivation for Gra*fast* in the
first place) was to shift load from the PostgreSQL layer (which is non-trivial
to scale) to the Node.js layer (which is easy to scale horizontally).

### Postgres Arrays now parse 5x faster

We've also [backported](https://github.com/bendrucker/postgres-array/pull/19)
these [fixes](https://github.com/bendrucker/postgres-array/pull/20) into the
`postgres-array` npm module for everyone that uses `pg` to benefit from.

### Easier to write SQL fragments

Added a new feature to `pg-sql2` that allows us to handle non-SQL parameter
embeds with custom code, making it easier to write custom SQL, e.g. if a value
is already coming from SQL you can embed it directly without having to invoke
placeholder:

```diff
 const $fooId = $foo.get('id');
-$pgSelect.where(sql`foo_id = ${$pgSelect.placeholder($fooId)}`);
+$pgSelect.where(sql`foo_id = ${$fooId}`);
```

We've also added the ability to embed dynamic SQL fragments that can be
dependent on runtime values (these values must be unary, i.e. they must come
from GraphQL field arguments or derivatives thereof):

```ts
const $includeArchived = fieldArgs.getRaw("includeArchived");
const $condition = lambda($includeArchived, (includeArchived) =>
  includeArchived ? sql.true : sql`is_archived is false`,
);
$pgSelect.where($condition);
```

### Join our testing community

If you use Discord, join our server at [https://discord.gg/graphile](https://discord.gg/graphile) and chat away with other V5 users — talk over the new features, discuss any issues you encounter and explore different ways of using the new projects. We look forward to welcoming you and hearing of your suggestions and successes with V5!
