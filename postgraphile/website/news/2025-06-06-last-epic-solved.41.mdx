<p className={styles.intro}>

In the first Gra<em>fast</em> Working Group, we outlined 4 <em>major</em> issues in Gra<em>fast</em>
that needed to be addressed before we could think about general release. The fourth, and final,
epic has now been solved!

- ✅ Global dependencies — solved via “unary” steps
- ✅ Early exit — solved via “flags”
- ✅ Eradicating eval
- ✅ **Polymorphism — this release!**

</p>

Gra*fast* is the cutting-edge GraphQL planning and execution engine which PostGraphile
uses, allowing it to build much more efficient SQL queries than PostGraphile V4 could
achieve, whilst also significantly expanding the capabilities of the system - not to
mention solving some longstanding issues!

### Polymorphism epic achieved

In previous versions of Gra*fast* there was the possibility of exponential plan
branching due to the naive method of resolution of abstract types.

By moving the responsibility of polymorphic resolution from field plan resolvers
into the abstract types themselves, we’ve centralized this logic, simplified
field plan resolvers, and unlocked more optimization opportunities and greater
execution efficiency. Polymorphic branches in one layer are now merged into a
single “combined” step before planning the next level of polymorphism.

  <code>Animal</code> ID and so they are combined together in order to fetch all
  of the required Animals by their IDs. Once the IDs are fetched, the nodes can
  branch out to the different Animal types.

Users of PostGraphile’s Postgres-based polymorphism should not need to take any action to
benefit from these changes, and may notice that their SQL queries are now
slightly smaller.

### TypeDefs / plans overhaul

In order to make the libraries more type safe, `makeGrafastSchema` (from
`grafast`) and `makeExtendSchemaPlugin` (from `postgraphile/utils`) have
deprecated the `typeDefs`/`plans` pattern since `plans` (like `resolvers` in the
traditional format) ended up being a mish-mash of lots of different types
(objects, scalars, enums, etc) and `__`-prefixed fields (`__resolveType`,
`__isTypeOf`, etc) for methods on the type itself.

Going forwards, the configuration should be split into `typeDefs` with
`objects`, `interfaces`, `unions`, `inputObjects`, `scalars` and `enums` as
appropriate. Type-level properties such as
`resolveType`/`isTypeOf`/`planType`/`scope`/etc are no longer prefixed with `__`
and, to avoid conflicts with these type-level properties, object and input
object fields should be specified inside a new `plans` property and enum values
within the new `values` property.

**The old pattern will still work** (this is not a breaking change), but we
recommend moving to the new shape and will use it for all of our examples in the
documentation from now on.

Migration is quite straightforward:

1. **Add new top-level properties**. Add `objects`, `interfaces`, `unions`,
   `inputObjects`, `scalars`, and `enums` as top level properties alongside
   `typeDefs` and `plans`. Each should be an empty object. You can skip any
   where you’re not defining types of that kind.

1. **Split definitions based on type kind**. For each type defined in `plans`
   move it into the appropriate new object (based on keyword defining the type;
   i.e. `type` &rarr; `objects`, `interface` &rarr; `interfaces`, `union` &rarr;
   `unions`, `input object` &rarr; `inputObjects`, `scalar` &rarr; `scalars`,
   `enum` &rarr; `enums`).

1. **Move field plans into nested `plans: {...}` object**. For each type defined
   in the new `objects` and `inputObjects` objects: create a `plans: { ... }`
   entry inside the type and move all fields (anything not prefixed with `__`)
   inside this new (nested) property.

1. **Move enum values into nested `values: {...}` object**. For each type
   defined in the new `enums` object: create a `values: { ... }` entry inside
   the type and move all values (anything not prefixed with `__`) inside this
   new (nested) property.

1. **Remove `__` prefixes**. For each type across
   `objects`/`interfaces`/`unions`/`interfaceObjects`/`scalars` and `enums`:
   remove the `__` prefix from any methods/properties.

Example:

```diff
 typeDefs: ...,
-plans: {
+objects: {
   User: {
-    __isTypeOf(v) {
+    isTypeOf(v) {
       return v.username != null;
     },
    plans: {
       fieldName($source, fieldArgs) {
         // ...
       },
+    },
   },
+},
+interfaces: {,
   MyInterface: {
-    __resolveType($specifier) {
+    resolveType($specifier) {
       // ...
     }
   }
+},
+enums: {
   MyEnum: {
     ONE
     TWO
     THREE
   }
 },
```

of these instructions into ChatGPT and it managed to convert a number of plugins
perfectly! YMMV.)_

### And more besides...

In reaching this epic milestone, we have <strong>bumped the minimum version of node.js to
Node 22</strong> (the latest LTS); we have also found and fixed a number of other issues both
in PostGraphile and the wider Graphile suite, you can see a full list at
[graphile.org](htts://graphile.org/news/20250606-last-epic-reached).
