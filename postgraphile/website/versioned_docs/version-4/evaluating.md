# Evaluating PostGraphile for your project

Hopefully youâ€™ve been convinced that PostGraphile serves an awesome GraphQL API,
but now letâ€™s take a more critical look at whether or not you should adopt
PostGraphile for your project.

PostGraphileâ€™s audience is for people who want to prioritize their product.
PostGraphile allows you to define your content model in the database as you
normally would, however instead of building the bindings to the database (your
API) PostGraphile takes care of it.

This takes a huge maintenance burden off your shoulders. Now you donâ€™t have to
worry about optimizing the API and the database, instead you can focus on just
optimizing your database. Scaling a database is well-understood - and you can
combine techniques - scaling vertically with larger database servers (more RAM,
faster storage), or horizontally with read replicas.

### No lock-in

PostGraphile does not lock you into using PostGraphile forever - in fact most of
the work you do implementing a PostGraphile API is in your database, which you
can take with you if you chose to move to a different system, so no work is
lost. If you feel comfortable with the cost of building your API, PostGraphile
is simple to switch with a custom solution - you can even export the GraphQL SDL
PostGraphile builds for you so you just need to implement your own resolvers.

PostGraphile does not ask you to do anything too divergent with your PostgreSQL
schema, allowing you to take your schema (and all your data) to whatever
solution you build next, and being confident that it was well designed - hand
rolled by you! GraphQL itself provides a simple and clear deprecation path if
you want to start using different fields. And of course with Graphile Engine
plugins you can extend (or remove) functionality as you wish.

Further, you can migrate away from PostGraphile bit by bit by placing a GraphQL
proxy in front of it and redirecting certain resolvers to your new solution.
This enables you to move away from PostGraphile with zero downtime.

Ideally PostGraphile will scale with your company, however there is a simple
exit path even years into the business. We welcome your contributions to help
PostGraphile scale and meet your needs, and are very open to sponsored
improvements to the software.

### Schema-driven APIs

If you fundamentally disagree with a one-to-one mapping of a SQL schema to an
API (GraphQL or otherwise) this section is for you.

First of all, PostGraphile is not necessarily meant to be the be-all and end-all
of your API. PostGraphile was created to allow you to focus on your product and
not the API. If you need to integrate external systems, there are plugin
interfaces to help you do that, and they're getting easier to use all the time.
If you want a custom API there is a simple transition path (read
[no lock-in](#no-lock-in)). If you still canâ€™t get over the one-to-one nature of
PostGraphile consider the following arguments why putting your business logic in
PostgreSQL is a good idea:

1.  PostgreSQL already has a powerful [user management system][user-management]
    with fine grained [row-level security][row-level-security]. A custom API
    would mean you have to build your own user management and security, and
    having to guarantee that every possible route to your database data is
    vetted by the same permissions logic (which PostgreSQL RLS does for you).
2.  PostgreSQL allows you to hide implementation details with [views][pg-views]
    of your data. Simple views can even be [auto-updatable][pg-udpatable-views].
    This provides you with the same freedom and flexibility as you might want
    from a custom API except more performant.
3.  PostgreSQL gives you automatic relations with the `REFERENCES` constraint
    and PostGraphile [automatically detects them](./relations). With a custom
    API, youâ€™d need to hardcode these relationships, which can become quite a
    chore!
4.  For what itâ€™s worth, you can write in your favorite scripting language in
    PostgreSQL, including [JavaScript][js-in-pg] and [Ruby][ruby-in-pg].
5.  If you donâ€™t want to write your code inside PostgreSQL, you could also use
    PostgreSQLâ€™s [`NOTIFY`][pg-notify] feature to fire events to a listening
    Ruby or [JavaScript][node-pg-notify] microservice (this could include email
    transactions and event reporting), implement a job queue, or add a Graphile
    Engine plugin to wrap or replace a PostGraphile resolver.

Still worried about a certain aspect of a schema-driven API? Open an issue,
we're confident we can convince you otherwise ðŸ˜‰
