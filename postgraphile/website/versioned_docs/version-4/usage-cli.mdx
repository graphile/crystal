# Command Line Interface

The easiest way to get up and running with PostGraphile is to use the Command
Line Interface.

Install PostGraphile globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g postgraphile
```

This will make the `postgraphile` command available. You can then run:

```bash
postgraphile -c postgres:///mydb -s public -a -j
```

where `-c` is the connection string (defaults to `postgres:///`), `-s` is the
schema name (defaults to "public"), `-a` enables Relay support and `-j` enables
dynamic JSON.

**macOS users**: you should also use the `--port` option to bind to a different
port, the default port 5000 now conflicts with macOS Monterey's new AirPlay
service.

PostGraphile also reads options from a `.postgraphilerc.js` file from the
current working directory.

### Recommended options

As PostGraphile evolves, we add more features; however we can't always enable
these features by default as they may be breaking changes. There are also
options that may have security repercussions. For this reason, many features are
behind flags. We understand this page is very long, so we've included some
default option sets you might like to use:

We recommend you install the `@graphile-contrib/pg-simplify-inflector` plugin.

#### For Development

```bash
postgraphile \
  --subscriptions \
  --watch \
  --dynamic-json \
  --no-setof-functions-contain-nulls \
  --no-ignore-rbac \
  --show-error-stack=json \
  --extended-errors hint,detail,errcode \
  --append-plugins @graphile-contrib/pg-simplify-inflector \
  --export-schema-graphql schema.graphql \
  --graphiql "/" \
  --enhance-graphiql \
  --allow-explain \
  --enable-query-batching \
  --legacy-relations omit \
  --connection $DATABASE_URL \
  --schema app_public
```

#### For Production

```bash
postgraphile \
  --subscriptions \
  --retry-on-init-fail \
  --dynamic-json \
  --no-setof-functions-contain-nulls \
  --no-ignore-rbac \
  --extended-errors errcode \
  --append-plugins @graphile-contrib/pg-simplify-inflector \
  --disable-graphiql \
  --enable-query-batching \
  --disable-query-log \ # our default logging has performance issues, but do make sure you have a logging system in place!
  --legacy-relations omit \
  --connection $DATABASE_URL \
  --schema app_public
```

### CLI options

There are more CLI options available to customise the GraphQL server (these are
from <tt>postgraphile@<span></span>4.12.3</tt>):

- `-V`, `--version`  
  output the version number
- `--plugins <string>`  
  a list of PostGraphile server plugins (not Graphile Engine schema plugins) to
  load; if present, must be the _first_ option
- `-c`, `--connection <string>`  
  the PostgreSQL database name or connection string. If omitted, inferred from
  environmental variables (see

- `-s`, `--schema <string>`  
  a Postgres schema to be introspected. Use commas to define multiple schemas
- `-S`, `--subscriptions`  
  Enable GraphQL support for subscriptions (you still need a subscriptions
  plugin currently)
- `--websockets <string>`  
  Choose which websocket transport libraries to use. Use commas to define
  multiple. Defaults to 'v0,v1' if `--subscriptions` or `--live` were passed,
  '[]' otherwise
- `--websocket-operations <operations>`  
  Toggle which GraphQL websocket transport operations are supported:
  'subscriptions' or 'all'. Defaults to 'subscriptions'

  updated payload any time nested collections/records change). Implies
  --subscriptions

  PostGraphile to keep trying to build the schema with exponential backoff
  rather than exiting

  [RECOMMENDED] enable dynamic JSON in GraphQL inputs and outputs. PostGraphile
  uses stringified JSON by default
- `-N`, `--no-setof-functions-contain-nulls`

  [RECOMMENDED] set this to exclude fields, queries and mutations that are not
  available to any possible user (determined from the user in connection string
  and any role they can become); this will be enabled by default in v5
- `--no-ignore-indexes`  
  [RECOMMENDED] set this to exclude filters, orderBy, and relations that would
  be expensive to access due to missing indexes
- `--include-extension-resources`  
  by default, tables and functions that come from extensions are excluded; use

The following options are not part of PostGraphile core, but are available from
the `@graphile/pg-pubsub` [subscriptions plugin](./subscriptions) (formerly the
paid "supporter" plugin, but now fully free and open source - please consider
[sponsoring us](https://graphile.org/sponsor/)!):

- `-S`, `--simple-subscriptions` add simple subscription support
- `--subscription-authorization-function [fn]` PG function to call to check user
  is allowed to subscribe.

The following features and not part of PostGraphile core, but are available from
the Pro plugin - see [Go Pro!](/pricing) for more information.

- `--read-only-connection <string>` <Pro /> <Spon /> ⚡️[experimental] a PostgreSQL
  connection string to use for read-only queries (i.e. not mutations)
- `--default-pagination-cap [int]` <Pro /> <Spon /> ⚡️[experimental] Ensures all
  connections have first/last specified and are no large than this value
  (default: 50), set to -1 to disable; override via smart comment
  `@paginationCap 50`
- `--graphql-depth-limit [int]` <Pro /> <Spon /> ⚡️[experimental] Validates GraphQL
  queries cannot be deeper than the specified int (default: 16), set to -1 to
  disable
- `--graphql-cost-limit [int]` <Pro /> <Spon /> ⚡️[experimental] Only allows queries with
  a computed cost below the specified int (default: 1000), set to -1 to disable

### RC file options

The CLI options can also be specified in a `.postgraphilerc.js` file in the
current working directory. Any command line comma separated options (eg.
`schema`) must be entered as Javascript arrays.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  options: {
    connection: "postgres://api_user:api_password@localhost/api_development",
    schema: ["myApp", "myAppPrivate"],
    jwtSecret: "myJwtSecret",
    defaultRole: "myapp_anonymous",
    jwtTokenIdentifier: "myApp.jwt_token",
    watch: true,
  },
};
```

Here is the list of keys and their default values, or types, supported in the
`options` object returned by `.postgraphilerc.js`.

```
  appendPlugins: <string>
  bodySizeLimit: <string>
  classicIds = false
  clusterWorkers: <integer>
  connection: <string>
  cors= false
  defaultRole: <string>
  disableDefaultMutations = false
  disableGraphiql = false
  disableQueryLog: true/false
  dynamicJson = false
  enableQueryBatching: true/false
  exportSchemaGraphql: <path string>
  exportSchemaJson: <path string>
  extendedErrors = []
  graphiql = '/graphiql'
  graphql = '/graphql'
  host = 'localhost'
  includeExtensionResources = false
  jwtAudiences: <string>
  jwtRole = ['role']
  jwtSecret: <string>
  jwtSignOptions: {}
  jwtTokenIdentifier
  jwtVerifyAlgorithms: <string>
  jwtVerifyAudience: <string>
  jwtVerifyClockTolerance: <number>
  jwtVerifyId: <string>
  jwtVerifyIgnoreExpiration: true/false
  jwtVerifyIgnoreNotBefore: true/false

  readCache: <path string>
  schema: <string>
  secret: <string>

  simpleCollections: [omit|both|only]
  skipPlugins: <string>
  timeout: <number>
  token: : <string>
  watch: true/false
  writeCache: <path string>
```

Please note that this interface is deprecated and will be removed in v5 (but its
replacement hasn't been built yet...). You're encouraged to use PostGraphile as
a library rather than using a `.postgraphilerc.js`.
