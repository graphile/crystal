title: Security
---

Traditionally in web application architectures the security is implemented in
the server layer and the database is treated as a simple store of data. Partly
this was due to necessity (the security policies offered by databases such as
PostgreSQL were simply not granular enough), and partly this was people figuring
it would reduce the workload on the database thus increases scalability.
However, as applications grow, they start needing more advanced features or
additional services to interact with the database. There's a couple options they
have here: duplicate the authentication/authorization logic in multiple places
(which can lead to discrepancies and increases the surface area for potential
issues), or make sure everything goes through the original application layer
(which then becomes both the development and performance bottleneck).

However, this is no longer necessary since PostgreSQL introduced much more
granular permissions in the form of
[Row-Level Security (RLS) policies](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ddl-rowsecurity.html)
in PostgreSQL 9.5 back at the beginning of 2016. Now you can combine this with
PostgreSQL established permissions system (based on roles) allowing your
application to be considerably more specific about permissions: adding row-level
permission constraints to the existing table- and column-based permissions.

Now that this functionality is stable and proven (and especially with the
performance improvements in the latest PostgreSQL releases), we advise that you
protect your lowest level - the data itself. By doing so you can be sure that no
matter how many services interact with your database they will all be protected
by the same underlying permissions logic, which you only need to maintain in one
place. You can add as many microservices as you like, and they can talk to the
database directly!

When Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled, all rows are by default not visible to
any roles (except database administration roles and the role who created the
database/table); and permission is selectively granted with the use of policies.

If you already have a secure database schema that implements these technologies
to protect your data at the lowest levels then you can leverage `postgraphile`
to generate a powerful, secure and fast API very rapidly. You just need to
generate JWT tokens for your users (and we even help you with that), or use
[pgSettings](./usage-library/#pgsettings-function) to indicate the current user.

### Processing JWTs

To enable the JWT functionality you must provide a `preset.schema.pgJwtSecret`.
This will allow PostGraphile to authenticate incoming JWTs and set the granted
claims on the database transaction.

### Generating JWTs

PostGraphile also has support for generating JWTs easily from inside your
PostgreSQL schema.

To do so we will take a composite type that you specify via `preset.gather.pgJwtTypes`:

```js title="graphile.config.mjs"
export default {
  gather: {
    pgJwtTypes: "jwt_token",
  },
  //...
};
```

The value of this setting is a schema-name, type-name tuple. Whenever a value
of the type identified by this tuple is returned from a PostgreSQL function we
will instead sign it with your JWT secret and return it as a string JWT token
as part of your GraphQL response payload.

For example, you might define a composite type such as this in PostgreSQL:

```sql
create type my_public_schema.jwt_token as (
  role text,
  exp integer,
  person_id integer,
  is_admin boolean,
  username varchar
);
```

Then run PostGraphile with this configuration

```js title="graphile.config.mjs"
import { PostGraphileAmberPreset } from "postgraphile/presets/amber";

export default {
  extends: [PostGraphileAmberPreset],
  gather: {
    // highlight-next-line
    pgJwtTypes: "my_public_schema.jwt_token",
  },
  schema: {
    // highlight-next-line
    pgJwtSecret: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
  },
};
```

And finally you might add a PostgreSQL function such as:

```sql {5}
create function my_public_schema.authenticate(
  email text,
  password text
)
returns my_public_schema.jwt_token
as $$
declare
  account my_private_schema.person_account;
begin
  select a.* into account
    from my_private_schema.person_account as a
    where a.email = authenticate.email;

  if account.password_hash = crypt(password, account.password_hash) then
    return (
      'person_role',
      extract(epoch from now() + interval '7 days'),
      account.person_id,
      account.is_admin,
      account.username
    )::my_public_schema.jwt_token;
  else
    return null;
  end if;
end;
$$ language plpgsql strict security definer;
```

Which would give you an `authenticate` mutation with which you can extract the
`jwtToken` from the response payload.

<!-- TODO: test this! -->

### Sending JWTs to the server

JWTs are sent via the best practice `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN_HERE
```

e.g.
[with Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/networking/authentication/#header):

```js {7,13}
const httpLink = createHttpLink({
  uri: "/graphql",
});

const authLink = setContext((_, { headers }) => {
  // get the authentication token from wherever you store it
  const token = getJWTToken();
  // return the headers to the context so httpLink can read them
  return {
    headers: {
      ...headers,
      // Only pass the authorization header if we have a JWT
      ...(token ? { authorization: `Bearer ${token}` } : null),
    },
  };
});

const client = new ApolloClient({
  link: authLink.concat(httpLink),
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
```

or [with Relay](https://relay.dev/docs/guides/network-layer/)

```js {3,8}
function fetchQuery( operation, variables, cacheConfig, uploadables) {
  // get the authentication token from wherever you store it
  const token = getJWTToken();
  return fetch('/graphql', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'content-type': 'application/json'
      authorization: token ? `Bearer ${token}` : "",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query: operation.text, // GraphQL text from input
      variables,
    }),
  }).then(response => {
    return response.json();
  });
}

const environment = new Environment({
  network: Network.create(fetchQuery),
  store: new Store(new RecordSource()),
});
```

#### Sending over a websocket

If you are using Apollo:

```js {5,10}
// get the authentication token from wherever you store it
const token = getJWTToken();

const wsLink = new WebSocketLink({
  uri: "ws://localhost:3000/graphql",
  options: {
    reconnect: true,
    connectionParams: token
      ? {
          authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
        }
      : {},
  },
});
```

### How it works

Your JWT token will include a number of claims, something like:

```json
{
  "aud": "postgraphile",
  "role": "app_user",
  "user_id": 27
}
```

When we verify that the JWT token is for us (via `aud: "postgraphile"`) we can
authenticate the PostgreSQL client that is used to perform the GraphQL query.
The PostgreSQL adaptor might use something like this to achieve this goal:

```sql
begin;
set local role app_user;
set local jwt.claims.role to 'app_user';
set local jwt.claims.user_id to '2';

-- PERFORM GRAPHQL QUERIES HERE

commit;
```

:::info

To save roundtrips, many adaptors perform just one query to set all configs via:

```sql
select set_config('role', 'app_user', true), set_config('user_id', '2', true), ...
```

but showing `set local` is simpler to understand.

:::

You can then access this information via `current_setting` (the second argument
says it's okay for the property to be missing); for example here's a helper
function:

```sql
create function current_user_id() returns integer as $$
  select nullif(current_setting('jwt.claims.user_id', true), '')::integer;
$$ language sql stable;
```

e.g. you might have a row level policy such as:

```sql
create policy update_if_author
  on comments
  for update
  using ("userId" = current_user_id())
  with check ("userId" = current_user_id());
```
