# PostGraphile Community Plugins

Community members can write plugins for PostGraphile that extends its
functionality; this page lists some of them. Issues with these plugins should be
directed to the plugin authors, not to this project. This page is maintained by
the community and is not an endorsement by the project.

If you have written a PostGraphile plugin (or have found one that is not listed
here), then please feel free to add it, you can use the “edit this page” link below
to do so.

See [the configuration docs](./config) for how to load
plugins.
