title: Filtering
---

Out of the box, PostGraphile supports rudimentary filtering on
[connections](./connections) using a `condition` argument. This allows you to
filter using equality with specific values (e.g. `username: "Alice"` or
`category: ARTICLE`).

[See an example using the `connection` argument.](./examples/#Collections__Relation_condition)

It's important when implementing filters to keep performance in mind. By
default (unless you're using the V4 preset), PostGraphile will not allow you to
filter by a column that isn't indexed. To force a column to appear in the
filtering options you can applying the `@behavior filterBy` [smart
tag](./smart-tags) to the relevant column, or you can use `@behavior -filterBy`
to force it remove it.

### Advanced filtering

You can extend PostGraphile's schema with more advance filtering capabilities by
adding fields using [custom queries](./custom-queries),
[computed columns](./computed-columns) or by using
[makeExtendSchemaPlugin](./make-extend-schema-plugin).

To add a condition to an existing condition another option is the
[`makeAddPgTableConditionPlugin`](./make-add-pg-table-condition-plugin). You
can also augment PostGraphile's existing connections using custom [Graphile
Engine plugins](./extending-raw), such as the following:

A very popular plugin is Matt Bretl's connection-filter plugin, located at
[https://github.com/graphile-contrib/postgraphile-plugin-connection-filter](https://github.com/graphile-contrib/postgraphile-plugin-connection-filter).
This adds a `filter` argument to connections that enables you to use advanced
filters, including filtering on related records from other tables, using greater
than, less than and ranges for filtering, and even filtering against the output
of functions. If you need advanced filtering in your GraphQL API (and you can
use something like
[persisted queries](./production/#simple-query-whitelist-persisted-queries) to
prevent malicious parties issuing complex requests) then I recommend you check
it out! (But do keep the caveats above in mind.)

#### Other plugins

Some more of the community plugins relate to filtering, you can read more about
them on the [community plugins page](./community-plugins)
