title: Command-line (CLI) usage

# Command Line Interface

The easiest way to get up and running with PostGraphile is to use the Command
Line Interface.

To try without installing, run the `pgl` command via the `npx` command that
comes bundled with Node.js:

```
npx pgl@beta -P pgl/amber -e -c postgres:///mydb
```

:::info

You should replace `postgres:///mydb` with a PostgreSQL connection string
pointing at your database, and if you use a non-standard PostgreSQL schema you
should indicate the schema name via `-s my_schema_name_here`.

:::

For a more permanent installation we suggest you create yourself a new
directory for your project, we'll refer to this as `~/postgraphile`. Open a
terminal in this directory and install PostGraphile:

```bash npm2yarn
cd ~/postgraphile
npm install postgraphile@beta
```

You can then run PostGraphile equivalent to above via:

```bash npm2yarn
npx postgraphile -P postgraphile/presets/amber -e -c postgres:///mydb
```

:::caution

The `-e` option should only be used in development.

:::

### CLI flags

The CLI accepts a small number of configuration options to get you started. It
also reads [options from a `graphile.config.js`](./config.mdx) file from the
current working directory (if it exists); by specifying all options in this file
you can run PostGraphile with no (or minimal) CLI flags.

- `--version`  
  output the version number
- `--help`  
  output usage information
- `--preset <string>` (alias: `-P`)
  <equivalent>{`{ extends: [...] }`}</equivalent>
  can be used to specify a comma-separated list of presets to add to the configuration
- `--allow-explain` (alias: `-e`)
  <equivalent>{`{ grafast: { explain: true } }`}</equivalent>
  enables "explain" mode, you won't want this in production but it's very helpful
  in development to know what's going on
- `--connection <string>` (alias: `-c`)
  <equivalent>{`{ pgServices: [makePgService({ connectionString: '...' })] }`}</equivalent>
  the PostgreSQL connection string. If omitted, inferred from <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-envars.html">
    environmental variables
  </a>
  .<br />
  Examples: <code>db</code>, <code>postgres:///db</code>, <code>postgres://user:password@domain:port/db?ssl=true</code>
- `--superuser-connection <string>` (alias: `-S`)
  <equivalent>{`{ pgServices: [makePgService({ superuserConnectionString:'...' })] }`}</equivalent>
  the PostgreSQL superuser connection string to use for installing watch fixtures
  (if <code>--watch</code> is enabled). If omitted, the regular connection string
  will be used.
- `--schema <string>` (alias: `-s`)
  <equivalent>{`{ pgServices: [makePgService({ schemas: ['...'] })] }`}</equivalent>
  a comma-separated list of PostgreSQL schemas to be introspected.
- `--watch` (alias: `-w`)
  <equivalent>{`{ grafserv: { watch: true } }`}</equivalent>
  automatically updates your GraphQL schema when your database schema changes (NOTE:
  requires DB superuser to install <code>postgraphile_watch</code> schema)
- `--host <string>` (alias: `-n`)
  <equivalent>{`{ grafserv: { host: 'localhost' } }`}</equivalent>
  the hostname to be used. Defaults to <code>localhost</code>
- `--port <number>` (alias: `-p`)
  <equivalent>{`{ grafserv: { port: 5678 } }`}</equivalent>
  the port to be used. Defaults to 5678

## `pgl` vs `postgraphile`

New to V5 if PostGraphile is the `pgl` command. This is almost identical to the
`postgraphile` command (it actually defers to `postgraphile` under the hood),
with the following differences:

- `pgl` has no `peerDependencies` - as soon as you start installing plugins that need peerDependencies you should consider moving to `postgraphile`
- `pgl` exposes `postgraphile/presets/amber` as `pgl/amber` (and similar for `pgl/v4` and `pgl/relay`), so it's more concise

:::tip

`pgl` is most suitable for running from `npx` without the need to permanently
install anything. If you want to start using PostGraphile in your project you
should install `postgraphile` instead.
