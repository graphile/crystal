# PostGraphQL Forum Relay Example
This directory contains an example for a relay application that uses the GraphQL API generated by PostGraphQL.

The [`schema.sql`](https://github.com/calebmer/postgraphql/blob/master/examples/forum/schema.sql) is a symbolic link to the plain [Forum Example](https://github.com/calebmer/postgraphql/tree/master/examples/forum).

## Installation
Somehow you need to download this directory, do it however you like but we’ll go over how to do it with git here.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/calebmer/postgraphql.git
cd postgraphql/examples/forum-relay
```

## Running
Before you start you may wish to change the default env variables (PORT, etc.). Check the `.env` file the root directory of this example.
Once you are in the `forum-relay` directory, run the following:

**Note:** If you havn’t added the forum table yet do also run `npm run schema-up`.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

You can now navigate to the relay app at the url printend in your console.
