# Examples
This directory contains examples of PostGraphQL for people looking to learn it or looking for a good PostGraphQL reference.

If you are new to the PostGraphQL project, definitely go to the forum example!

- **`forum`**: The forum example is the best for beginners and people looking to spin up a PostGraphQL server to see what’s up. It contains the schema for a basic forum with users, posts, and comments.

- **`kitchen-sink`**: This example is used in integration testing for testing all the features of PostGraphQL. This example is also a good reference for writing a PostgreSQL schema.
