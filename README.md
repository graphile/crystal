Graphile Engine enables you to build high-performance easily-extensible GraphQL
schemas by combining plugins.

**NOTE**: _You might be looking for
[PostGraphile](https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile) which is Graphile
Engine applied to a PostgreSQL database._

## Monorepo contents

**[graphile-build][]**: The core of Graphile Engine: a plugin system that
enables you to build a GraphQL schema out of plugins with advanced performance
capabilities enabled via GraphQL look-ahead functionality.

**[graphile-build-pg][]**: A selection of graphile-build plugins related to
PostgreSQL: schema introspection, generation of fields and types for all tables,
computed columns, query procedures, etc - if there's certain features you don't
want, simply don't use that plugin!

**[graphile-utils][]**: A collection of helper utilities to make writing
graphile-build plugins easier.

**[postgraphile-core][]**: Contains the GraphQL schema functionality of
[PostGraphile][], does not contain the web layer.

**[graphql-parse-resolve-info][]**: Parses a `GraphQLResolveInfo` object into a
tree of the fields that are being requested to enable optimisations to your
GraphQL schema (e.g. we use it in `graphile-build-pg` to determine which fields
are required from the SQL database).

## Brief History

Proof of concept was built by [@Benjie](https://twitter.com/benjie) in 2017,
growing out of a need for greater performance, easier extensibility and greater
customisation in [PostGraphQL][postgraphile]. Over the next year thanks to the
input of the community and ongoing development and testing, Graphile Engine has
matured into the production-ready system it is today.

## Development

Below is a quick-start, for more detailed instructions, please
[see the CONTRIBUTING.md documentation in PostGraphile](https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

```bash
yarn
yarn watch
```

`yarn watch` will keep monitoring and compiling the babel files, so open another
terminal to run the tests (Note: your PostgreSQL server must be
[configured for logical decoding](packages/lds/README.md#postgresql-configuration)):

```bash
createdb graphileengine_test
export TEST_DATABASE_URL="postgres:///graphileengine_test"
yarn test
```

If the above succeeds, you're good to go! If not, please try again after running
`yarn install --force` and always feel free to reach out via
[our discord chat](http://discord.gg/graphile) on the #core-development channel.
