## About

**GraphQL** is a new way of communicating with your server. It eliminates the problems of over- and under-fetching, incorporates strong data types, has built-in introspection, documentation and deprecation capabilities, and is implemented in many programming languages. This all leads to gloriously low-latency user experiences, better developer experiences, and much increased productivity. Because of all this, GraphQL is typically used as a replacement for (or companion to) RESTful API services.

**PostgreSQL** is the self-proclaimed ‚Äúworld‚Äôs most advanced open source database,‚Äù with each new release bringing more amazing features and performance gains. Thinking of your database as a plain CRUD store is now an archaic viewpoint as modern PostgreSQL can do so much for you &mdash; from authorization with Row-Level Security (RLS, introduced in PG9.5), through Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW), to real time notifications with `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY`.

**PostGraphile** pairs these two incredible technologies together, helping you not only build applications more rapidly, but to build lightning-fast applications. PostGraphile allows you to access the power of PostgreSQL through a well designed, extensible, customisable and incredibly performant GraphQL server. It automatically detects tables, columns, indexes, relationships, views, types, functions, comments, and more - providing a GraphQL server that is highly intelligent about your data, and that automatically updates itself without restarting when you change your database schema.

With PostGraphile, a well designed database schema should serve the basis for a well thought out API. PostgreSQL already has amazing authorization and relationship infrastructure, _why duplicate that logic_ in a custom API? A PostGraphile API is likely to provide a more performant and standards compliant GraphQL API than any created in-house, and can be built in a fraction of the time. Focus on your product and let PostGraphile worry about the API layer. Once you need to expand beyond this, we have a powerful plugin system including many [community contributed plugins](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/community-plugins/). For a critical evaluation of PostGraphile to determine if it fits in your tech stack, read [evaluating PostGraphile for your project](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/evaluating/).

## Introduction

Watch a talk by the original author [Caleb](https://twitter.com/calebmer) at GraphQL Summit for a walk-through of building an application with PostGraphile in under 7 minutes. This was using v2 (then called PostGraphQL); we're now up to v4 which has many more bells and whistles!

[![PostGraphile at GraphQL Summit](https://img.youtube.com/vi/b3pwlCDy6vY/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3pwlCDy6vY)

Hear from the current maintainer [Benjie](https://twitter.com/benjie) at GraphQL Finland about the benefits of Database-Driven GraphQL Development:

[![Database Driven GraphQL Development at GraphQL Finland](https://img.youtube.com/vi/XDOrhTXd4pE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDOrhTXd4pE)

## Usage

**Documentation: [graphile.org/postgraphile](https://graphile.org/postgraphile)**

You can use PostGraphile via the CLI, as a Node.js middleware, or use the GraphQL schema directly. Make sure to check out the **[full usage instructions](https://graphile.org/postgraphile/usage/)** on the documentation website. We also have a [PostgreSQL schema design guide](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/postgresql-schema-design/) you can follow to build a fully functional PostGraphile API.

### CLI

To get started you can install PostGraphile globally:

```bash
npm install -g postgraphile
```

‚Ä¶and then just run it! By default, PostGraphile will connect to your local database at `postgres://localhost:5432` and introspect the `public` schema. See [the available CLI flags](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/usage-cli/) with:

```bash
postgraphile --help
```

When you're ready to use PostGraphile for your own project, you're advised to install it locally with `yarn`, and run it with `npx`:

```bash
yarn add postgraphile
npx postgraphile --help
```

**macOS users**: PostGraphile has used port 5000 by default for 5+ years; recently Apple decided to bind the AirPlay service to port 5000 causing a conflict. Please use the `--port` option to bind to a different port.

### Middleware

You can also use PostGraphile as [native HTTP, Connect, Express, or Koa (experimental) middleware](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/usage-library/), e.g.:

```bash
yarn add postgraphile
```

```js
import { createServer } from 'http';
import postgraphile from 'postgraphile';

createServer(postgraphile());
```

Check out [hapi-postgraphile](https://github.com/mshick/hapi-postgraphile) if you're interested in using PostGraphile as a [hapi](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi) server plugin.

### Docker

To run via Docker, simply pass the [CLI options](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/usage-cli/) to the Docker container:

```bash
docker pull graphile/postgraphile
docker run --init graphile/postgraphile --help
```

E.g. you might run this command (substituting the relevant variables):

```bash
docker run --init -p 5000:5000 graphile/postgraphile --connection postgres://POSTGRES_USER:POSTGRES_PASSWORD@POSTGRES_HOST:POSTGRES_PORT/POSTGRES_DATABASE --schema app_public --watch
```

**macOS users**: Please use a different port to avoid conflict with AirPlay.
