_**An instant, highly-performant GraphQL API for your PostgreSQL database, extensible via a powerful plugin system.**_

**Documentation: [graphile.org/postgraphile](https://graphile.org/postgraphile)**

_Note: v1-v3 of this project were named **PostGraphQL**. A v3-v4 migration guide is
available [here](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/v3-migration/) and you can check
out some of the new features
[here](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/v4-new-features/). No more
development is taking place on v3, but you can still access its branch
[here](https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile/tree/v3)._

**GraphQL** is a powerful new way to query your servers - it's typically used as a replacement for, or companion to, RESTful API services. Introduced by Facebook in 2015, it features strong data typing, built in introspection and documentation capabilities, and solves among many other things the problems of over- and under-fetching data. It's particularly great for mobile clients where minimizing number of requests, latency, and payload size are all critically important tasks - but this awesome mobile experience makes regular webpages much smoother too.

**PostgreSQL** is the self-proclaimed ‚Äúworld‚Äôs most advanced open source database,‚Äù and despite its over 20 year maturity this still rings true. New versions of PostgreSQL are released regularly, and each new major version brings incredible new features, not to mention massive performance gains. Seeing your database as just a plain CRUD store is now an archaic viewpoint, modern PostgreSQL can do so much for you: from enforcing business logic with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Row-Level Security (RLS), through communicating with other systems via Foreign Data Wrappers, to real time notifications with `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY`, PostgreSQL can handle it all with ease.

**PostGraphile** pairs these two incredible technologies together to help you not only build applications more rapidly, but to build faster applications! Access the power of PostgreSQL through a well designed, extensible, customisable and incredibly performant GraphQL server. PostGraphile uses PostgreSQL reflection APIs to automatically detect tables, columns, indexes, relationships, views, types, functions, comments, and more - providing a GraphQL server that is highly intelligent about your data. PostGraphile can automatically detect changes to your database (e.g. new columns or tables) and instantly rebuild and serve the updated GraphQL API - even updating GraphiQL automatically! This leads to incredible productivity gains, and helps developers multiply their impact.

With PostGraphile, a well designed database schema should be all you need to serve a well thought out API; and if it isn't - well, we have a powerful plugin system including many [community contributed plugins](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/community-plugins/)! PostgreSQL already has amazing authorization and relationship infrastructure, _why duplicate that logic_ in a custom API? A PostGraphile API is likely to provide a more performant and standards compliant GraphQL API then any created in-house, and can be built in a fraction of the time. Focus on your product and let PostGraphile worry about the API layer.

## Introduction

Watch a talk by the original author [Caleb](https://twitter.com/calebmer) at GraphQL Summit for a walk-through of building an application with PostGraphile in under 7 minutes. This was using v2 (then called PostGraphQL); we're now up to v4 which has many more bells and whistles!

## Usage

**Documentation: [graphile.org/postgraphile](https://graphile.org/postgraphile)**

You can use PostGraphile via the CLI, as a middleware, or just use the GraphQL schema directly. Make sure to check out the **[forum example][]** and especially **[step by step tutorial][]** for a demo of a PostGraphile compliant schema and authentication.

[forum example]: https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile/tree/master/examples/forum
[step by step tutorial]: https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile/blob/master/examples/forum/TUTORIAL.md

### CLI

Install using npm:

```bash
npm install -g postgraphile
```

‚Ä¶and then just run it! By default, PostGraphile will connect to your local database at `postgres://localhost:5432` and introspect the `public` schema. See [the available CLI flags](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/usage-cli/) with:

```bash
postgraphile --help
```

### Middleware

You can also use PostGraphile as [native HTTP, Connect, Express, or Koa (experimental) middleware](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/usage-library/), e.g.:

```js
import { createServer } from 'http';
import postgraphile from 'postgraphile';

createServer(postgraphile());
```

Check out [hapi-postgraphile](https://github.com/mshick/hapi-postgraphile) if you're interested in using PostGraphile as a [hapi](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi) server plugin.

### Docker

To run via Docker, simply pass the [CLI options](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/usage-cli/) to the Docker container:

```bash
docker pull graphile/postgraphile
docker run graphile/postgraphile --help
```

E.g. you might run this command (substituting the relevant variables):

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 graphile/postgraphile --connection postgres://POSTGRES_USER:POSTGRES_PASSWORD@POSTGRES_HOST:POSTGRES_PORT/POSTGRES_DATABASE --schema app_public --watch
```
