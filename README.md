_An instant, highly-performant GraphQL API for your PostgreSQL database._

**Documentation: [graphile.org/postgraphile](https://graphile.org/postgraphile)**

_Note: v1-v3 of this project were named **PostGraphQL**. A v3-v4 migration guide is
available [here](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/v3-migration/) and you can check
out some of the new features
[here](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/v4-new-features/). No more development is taking place on v3, but you can still access its branch [here](https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile/tree/v3)._

---

The strongly typed GraphQL data querying language is a revolutionary new way to interact with your server. Similar to how JSON very quickly overtook XML, GraphQL will likely overtake REST. Why? Because GraphQL allows us to express our data in the exact same way we think about it.

The PostgreSQL database is the self acclaimed ‚Äúworld‚Äôs most advanced open source database‚Äù and even after 20 years that still rings true. PostgreSQL is the most feature rich SQL database available and provides an excellent public reflection API giving its users a lot of power over their data. And despite being over 20 years old, the database still has frequent releases.

With PostGraphile, you can access the power of PostgreSQL through a well designed and highly performant GraphQL server. PostGraphile uses PostgreSQL reflection APIs to automatically detect primary keys, relationships, types, comments, and more providing a GraphQL server that is highly intelligent about your data.

PostGraphile believes that a _well designed database schema should be all you need to serve well thought out APIs_. PostgreSQL already has amazing authorization and relationship infrastructure, _why duplicate that logic_ in a custom API? A PostGraphile API is likely to provide a more performant and standards compliant GraphQL API then any created in house, and can be built in a fraction of the time. Focus on your product and let PostGraphile worry about the API layer.

For a critical evaluation of PostGraphile to determine if it fits in your tech stack, read [evaluating PostGraphile for your project](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/evaluating/).

## Introduction

Watch a talk by the original author [Caleb](https://twitter.com/calebmer) at GraphQL Summit for a fast 7 minute introduction to using the PostGraphile project. This was using v2; we're now up to v4 which has many more bells and whistles!

[![PostGraphile at GraphQL Summit](https://img.youtube.com/vi/b3pwlCDy6vY/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3pwlCDy6vY)

## Usage

**Documentation: [graphile.org/postgraphile](https://graphile.org/postgraphile)**

You can use PostGraphile via the CLI, as a middleware, or just use the GraphQL schema directly. Make sure to check out the **[forum example][]** and especially **[step by step tutorial][]** for a demo of a PostGraphile compliant schema and authentication.

[forum example]: https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile/tree/master/examples/forum
[step by step tutorial]: https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile/blob/master/examples/forum/TUTORIAL.md

### CLI

Install using npm:

```bash
npm install -g postgraphile
```

‚Ä¶and then just run it! By default, PostGraphile will connect to your local database at `postgres://localhost:5432` and introspect the `public` schema. See [the available CLI flags](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/usage-cli/) with:

```bash
postgraphile --help
```

### Middleware

You can also use PostGraphile as [native HTTP, Connect, Express, or Koa (experimental) middleware](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/usage-library/), e.g.:

```js
import { createServer } from "http";
import postgraphile from "postgraphile";

createServer(postgraphile());
```

Check out [hapi-postgraphile](https://github.com/mshick/hapi-postgraphile) if you're interested in using PostGraphile as a [hapi](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi) server plugin.

### Docker

To run via Docker, simply pass the [CLI options](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/usage-cli/) to the Docker container:

```bash
docker pull graphile/postgraphile
docker run graphile/postgraphile --help
```

E.g. you might run this command (substituting the relevant variables):

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 graphile/postgraphile --connection postgres://POSTGRES_USER:POSTGRES_PASSWORD@POSTGRES_HOST:POSTGRES_PORT/POSTGRES_DATABASE --schema app_public --watch
```

## Thanks

Huge thanks to [the individuals who sponsor PostGraphile's development](SPONSORS.md) - their support helps me spend more time working on the project! If you want the project to advance more rapidly, please join them in supporting this project üôè

A humongous, heart-felt, thank you to the original author of PostGraphile - [Caleb Meredith](https://twitter.com/calebmer) - for everything he put into PostGraphile! He's now graduated from the project and we all wish him the best for his future ventures!

Thanks also to the people working on [PostgREST](https://github.com/begriffs/postgrest) which was a huge inspiration for this project!

Thanks and enjoy üëç
