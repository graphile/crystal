#### Live Queries

Live query fields are differentiated by containing \`(live)\` at the end of their description, \
they are added for each field in the \`Query\` type. \
When you subscribe to a live query field, the selection set will be evaluated and sent to the \
client, and then most things\\* that would cause the output of the selection set to change \
will trigger the selection set to be re-evaluated and the results to be re-sent to the client.

_(\\* Not everything: typically only changes to persisted data referenced by the query are detected, not computed fields.)_

Live queries can be very expensive, so try and keep them small and focussed.

#### Events

Event fields will run their selection set when, and only when, the specified server-side event occurs. \
This makes them a lot more efficient than Live Queries, but it is still recommended that you keep payloads fairly small.`;
