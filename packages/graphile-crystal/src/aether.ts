 * A "bucket" is where the results from plans are stored so that other plans

 * execution. A "BucketDefinition" is used to both identify the bucket and to
 * specify why it exists and how it behaves.
 *
 * Every `ExecutablePlan` belongs to exactly one bucket, specified by
 * `plan.bucketId`. Which bucket the plan belongs to is determined by:
 *
 * - `__ItemPlan`s trigger a new bucket for themselves and anything
 *   that depends on them.  This covers "list", "stream" and "subscription".
 * - Otherwise, plans that cross a `@defer` boundary (i.e. they're needed to resolve a
 *   `@defer`'d fragment but they aren't required to resolve the parent selection
 *   set (ignoring the deferred fragment)) will be assigned a new "defer"
 *   bucket.
 * - Otherwise, plans that cross a mutation field boundary (they exist for the
 *   mutation's result selection set) get a new bucket.
 * - Otherwise, plans that have no dependencies go into the root bucket
 * - Otherwise, if all the plan's dependencies' buckets overlap then the plan
 *   is assigned to the containing bucket (the largest bucket), and add the ids
 *   for plans not in this containing bucket to the containing bucket's
 *   `copyPlanIds`.
 * - Otherwise, a new "join" bucket is created representing the union of the
 *   largest non-overlapping buckets (and the relevant "copyPlanIds" are set).
 *
 * This value is then used to influence:
 *
 * 1. how plans are deduplicated
 * 2. the order in which the plans are executed
 * 3. where the result of executing the plan is stored
 * 4. when the plan execution cache is allowed to be GC'd
 *
 * NOTE: `__ListTransformPlan`'s effectively have a temporary bucket inside
 * them (built on the `__Item`) that's thrown away once the transform is
 * complete.

       *  When considering resolvers on fields, there's three booleans to

       *  - typeIsPlanned: Does the type the field is defined on expect a plan?
       *    - NOTE: the root types (Query, Mutation, Subscription) implicitly
       *      expect the "root plan"
       *  - fieldHasPlan: Does the field define a `plan()` method?
       *  - resultIsPlanned: Does the named type that the field returns (the
       *    "named field type") expect a plan?
       *    - NOTE: only object types, unions and interfaces may expect plans;
       *      but not all of them do.
       *    - NOTE: a union/interface expects a plan iff ANY of its object
       *      types expect plans
       *    - NOTE: if ANY object type in an interface/union expects a plan
       *      then ALL object types within the interface/union must expect
       *      plans.
       *    - NOTE: scalars and enums never expect a plan.
       *
       *  These booleans impact:
       *
       *  - Whether there must be a `plan()` declaration and what the "parent"
       *    argument is to the same
       *    - If typeIsPlanned:
       *      - Assert: `fieldHasPlan` must be true
       *      - Pass through the parent plan
       *    - Else, if resultIsPlanned:
       *      - Assert: `fieldHasPlan` must be true
       *      - Pass through a `__ValuePlan` representing the parent value.
       *    - Else, if fieldHasPlan:
       *      - Pass through a `__ValuePlan` representing the parent value.
       *    - Else
       *      - No action necessary.
       *  - If the field may define `resolve()` and what the "parent" argument
       *    is to the same
       *    - If resultIsPlanned
       *      - Assert: there must not be a `resolve()`
       *      - Crystal provides pure resolver.
       *    - Else if fieldHasPlan (which may be implied by typeIsPlanned
       *      above)
       *      - If `resolve()` is not set:
       *        - crystal will return the value from the plan directly
       *      - Otherwise:
       *        - Crystal will wrap this resolver and will call `resolve()` (or
       *          default resolver) with the plan result.  IMPORTANT: you may
       *          want to use an `ObjectPlan` so that the parent object is of
       *          the expected shape; e.g. your plan might return
       *          `object({username: $username})` for a `User.username` field.
       *    - Else
       *      - Leave `resolve()` untouched - do not even wrap it.
       *      - (Failing that, use a __ValuePlan and return the result
       *        directly.)
