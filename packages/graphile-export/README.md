`graphile-export` can export an in-memory GraphQL schema constructed with
various types of tooling to an on disk executable schema using (eventually) a
variety of formats. This is particularly useful if you want to remove the "build
time" dependencies of building your schema and have a highly optimised runtime
that does not require those dependencies. It's also useful for converting from
one schema builder to another - `graphile-export` is indifferent what tool was
used to build the schema (so long as it's a valid GraphQL.js schema), but can
export the schema to various tools.

## Caveats

Currently only one exporter (graphql.js) is implemented, but more will be
coming.

Though all GraphQL.js schemas can be exported, in many cases the resolvers will
not be fully functional due to missing dependencies.

TODO: explain why, and how to fix.
