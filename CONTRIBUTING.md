# Contributing

The PostGraphile project welcomes all contributors, we want to invest in you so
you can invest back into PostGraphile. Together we can make great software that
enables developers to build powerful applications in much less time then would
previously have been taken. This document aims to help you get started
contributing to the project.

## Development environment

First of all, our development environment is focussed around Unix tools. If
you are on Windows, you may need to use something like Docker or a VM to help
you develop.

Since PostGraphile is mostly powered by Graphile Engine the best way to
develop it is to do it in the context of a Graphile Engine build so that you
may dig into the depths if you need to.

### Yarn

We use yarn workspaces, so it's very important that you use the `yarn`
package manager rather an npm whilst developing PostGraphile.

```
npm install -g yarn
```

Before we start, check that you're running up to date versions of the relevant
tools, you should be running at least:

```
$ node --version
v10.13.0
$ yarn --version
1.12.1
$ git --version
git version 2.18.0
$ watchman --version # optional
4.9.0
```

(If you don't have `watchman` that's fine, but it helps when watching large
numbers of files. On Mac you can install it using homebrew:
`brew install watchman`)

To get started, we're going to check out `graphile-engine`, and then we're
going to check out `postgraphile` _inside of_ `graphile-engine`. With a few
tweaks this will enable `postgraphile` to use the development version of the
modules in `graphile-engine` without needing to perform `yarn link` etc.

It should be safe to copy and paste these commands into your terminal (one at
a time), but if you're using zsh you may want to run this first so that comments are ignored:

```
set -k
```

### Setup

Okay, here's the setup:

```bash
# Clone graphile-engine:
git clone git@github.com:graphile/graphile-engine.git graphile-engine

# Clone postgraphile _inside of_ graphile-engine:
git clone git@github.com:graphile/postgraphile.git graphile-engine/postgraphile

########################################

# Initial setup for graphile-engine
cd graphile-engine

# Install deps:
yarn
# Monorepo stuff:
yarn lerna bootstrap
# Run initial build:
yarn prepack:all

########################################

# Initial setup for postgraphile
cd postgraphile

# Install deps:
yarn
# Remove deps that should be served by the parent graphile-engine:
./rmlocal.sh
# Builds GraphiQL, images, etc so they can be require()d:
yarn make-assets
```

### Database setup

For testing, PostGraphile of course requires a Postgres database. [Download and install](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) it, e.g. with:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib postgresql-client-common
```

Then we need to set up a superuser (who can install extensions) and create test databases for the individual test suites.
You can use the [command line utilities](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/reference-client.html) or go with `psql`:

```
sudo -u postgres psql
  CREATE ROLE me WITH LOGIN SUPERUSER; -- PASSWORD 'mypassword'
  SET ROLE me;
  CREATE DATABASE postgraphile_test;
  COMMENT ON DATABASE postgraphile_test IS 'https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile';
  CREATE DATABASE graphileengine_test;
  COMMENT ON DATABASE graphileengine_test IS 'https://github.com/graphile/graphile-engine';
```

You may use the default `postgres` superuser instead of your own one if you prefer.
Using your OS login for naming the user `me` requires fewer customisations down the road, as on many systems it will be the default.

The [`lds` package](./lds/README.md) uses another database `lds_test`, this should be created automatically by its `yarn db:init` script.

To allow login without a password (please evaluate your own security requirements), you may change the [`pg_hba.conf`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/auth-pg-hba-conf.html) so that the user is always accepted from the local machine:

```
# for postgraphile testing
local	postgraphile_test,graphileengine_test,lds_test	all				trust
host	postgraphile_test,graphileengine_test,lds_test	me	127.0.0.1/32		trust
host	postgraphile_test,graphileengine_test,lds_test	me	::1/128			trust
```

You don't need to install Postgres locally, running it on an external server or in a Docker container (like [this](./run-pg)) works as well.
See below for how to make your database connections known to the test runner.

## Developing

### Graphile Engine

Graphile Engine is built in a mixture of TypeScript and Flow (we're slowly
migrating to TypeScript); which means it has a compile step. For developer
productivity we don't incur this compilation cost every time we run the
development version of PostGraphile, instead we require the compiled code in
most places. This means that we must watch the source code for changes so
that when we run the compiled code it's not out of date. To do this, in the
root of graphile-engine, run `yarn watch`:

```
yarn watch
```

This will compile everything, and then monitor for changes and compile just
the changed files. Every time a file is compiled it will be listed in the
output - **be careful to check for errors**!

You should leave this watch process running, so open another terminal to do
further work.

### PostGraphile

First, change into the postgraphile directory (`graphile-engine/postgraphile/`).

To run PostGraphile in development, you can use the `scripts/dev` command.
This command emulates the `postgraphile` command, and it has two modes. If
you want the `scripts/dev` command to exit when `postgraphile` would, add two
hyphens, e.g.

```bash
# Will run once and exit on error or `-X` option
scripts/dev -- -c postgres://localhost/my_db -s my_schema --watch --enhance-graphiql
```

The `--` makes `scripts/dev` act more like a regular build - i.e. exiting on
the `-X` commands or when an error occurs.

If, however, you want `scripts/dev` to automatically restart whenever you
change the PostGraphile or Graphile Engine source code, run it without the
`--`. To manually restart the server type in `rs` and hit enter while
`scripts/dev` is running.

```bash
# Will monitor the source for changes and restart automatically
scripts/dev -c postgres://localhost/my_db -s my_schema --watch --enhance-graphiql
```

## Updating or changing branches

Due to this peculiar setup, when you want to update or switch branches,
you have to do an extra couple steps than you might expect.

### Graphile Engine

(In the `graphile-engine` folder.)

Thanks to yarn workspaces, updating the `graphile-engine` folder
is straightforward:

```bash
git pull --rebase # or checkout a branch, or whatever
yarn # update deps
```

If you're running `yarn watch` in the `graphile-engine` folder then it's
probably a good idea to restart it incase any of the dependencies have
changed.

### PostGraphile

(In the `graphile-engine/postgraphile` folder.)

```
git pull --rebase # or checkout a branch, or whatever
yarn # update deps
./rmlocal.sh # Remove deps that should be served by the parent graphile-engine
```

The `./rmlocal.sh` script is the one you must remember to run again -
otherwise yarn will restore the release versions of `postgraphile-core`,
`graphile-build-pg` and `graphile-build`, thus your local changes won't be represented.

## Tests

PostGraphile uses [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/) for testing to take
advantage of Jestâ€™s snapshot feature. We test against a local database, so make sure [it is set up](#Database_setup).
PostgreSQL is by default running on `localhost:5432` (if that port isn't already used).

### Graphile Engine

Graphile Engine uses a user-configurable test database, for example `graphileengine_test`:

```
createdb graphileengine_test
```

The tests of the `postgraphile-core`, `graphile-utils` and `pg-pubsub` packages use the `TEST_DATABASE_URL` environment variable, which is mandatory.
Its format is a [connection URL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/libpq-connect.html#id-1.7.3.8.3.6), passed to [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/features/connecting#Connection URI).

The `lds` and `subscriptions-lds` packages' test commands will create and use a new `"lds_test"` database using the `createdb` command. If you cannot make `createdb` run directly without options (e.g. if you're not using `trust` authentication) then you may set the `LDS_TEST_DATABASE_URL` environment variable and seed the DB and run the tests manually (see the relevant `package.json` to see what is done by the `yarn test` command).
Note: before you can run those tests, you'll need to configure your PostgreSQL server to support logical decoding for the live queries tests.
See [the @graphile/lds README](packages/lds/README.md#postgresql-configuration) for how to enable `wal_level = logical`.

We must then export this `TEST_DATABASE_URL` environment variable so the tests
know where to install. **WARNING**: this database will be overwritten!

```
# assuming passwordless login is set up
export TEST_DATABASE_URL="postgres://localhost/graphileengine_test"
```

Then you can run the tests with

```
yarn test
```

This takes a while; I'd advise that you focus on the integration tests in
`postgraphile-core` in most cases; and since we're using jest you can pass a
filter such as `queries` to only run tests with a file name that contains the
word `queries`:

```
cd packages/postgraphile-core
yarn test queries
```

### PostGraphile

To run PostGraphile tests you will need to first create the
`postgraphile_test` database:

```bash
createdb postgraphile_test
```

The PostGraphile tests use the `TEST_PG_URL` environment variable as a connection URL, which can be overwritten. (This differs from the Graphile Engine `TEST_DATABASE_URL` to avoid conflicts between these two independent test suites.)
The default value is `'postgres:///postgraphile_test'`.

Then run the test suite with:

```bash
yarn test
```

When developing PostGraphile, we recommend using the Jest watch mode feature.
So instead you would run tests like so:

```bash
yarn test --watch
```

(If you get an error about too many open files, consider installing
`watchman` as mentioned above.)

Now, only the tests in the files you have changed will be run. There are some
slow tests in the PostGraphile suite so hopefully this should make your
development time faster. Once you are in watch mode, Jest will present you with
some options you can use to better configure your testing experience.

### Snapshots

We make use of the Jest snapshot feature. Even when you change small things
the snapshot tests are likely to fail, this is expected. To update the
snapshots so that the tests pass again, you can press `u` if you're running
in watch mode, or you can run `yarn test -u`. You should carefully review the
changes to the snapshots to ensure they're what you intended. Commit the
changes to the snapshots and the changed snapshots will be reviewed along
with the rest of your changes in the PR review process.

### Linting

PostGraphile uses ESLint and Travis CI to test builds and enforce lint rules:
[travis-ci.org/graphile/postgraphile](https://travis-ci.org/graphile/postgraphile).

## GraphiQL

The instance of GraphiQL used by PostGraphile is a
[`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
located in `postgraphiql`. When developing PostGraphile (running
`scripts/dev` only), GraphiQL will run on a different port to take advantage
of the `create-react-app` developer experience.

Note that `postgraphiql` has it's own `package.json` and `yarn.lock` because
it depends on a specific version of GraphQL which is different from the wide
range supported by PostGraphile/Graphile Engine. When we build PostGraphile
before publishing (with `scripts/build`), GraphiQL is built into a resources
served by the PostGraphile middleware people import into their projects.

## Commit messages

PostGraphile team use
[karma-style](http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/dev/git-commit-msg.html) commit
messages: a type (`feat`/`fix`/`chore`/`docs`/etc.), a scope
(`graphql`/`postgraphile`/`examples`/`tests`) and then the commit message.
Commit messages are written in the imperative tense.

Hereâ€™s a few examples:

```
feat(ci): run against multiple postgres versions
fix(postgraphile): fix opaque error messages
chore(docs): rename anonymous role to default role
```

When committing to a branch or a PR you do not need to adhere to this format.
However, all commits to the `master` branch _must_ be in this format. Often all
of the commits in a PR will be squashed and a commit message of this format
will be written to summarize the changes.

You must use one of the following types:

- `chore`
- `docs`
- `feat`
- `fix`
- `refactor`
- `style`
- `test`

Common scopes are as follows. You are not required to use any of the following
scopes and may instead invent your own. These are just a few that get commonly
used.

- `*`
- `postgraphile`
- `graphql`
- `interface`
- `postgres`
- `package`
- `scripts`
- `examples`
- `ci`

Here are some resources that will help you learn more about Postgres and
GraphQL so that you may understand more of what is going on inside
PostGraphile.
