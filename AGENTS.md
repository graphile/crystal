# AGENTS.md

**Audience:** code assistants (Aider, Cody, Copilot Chat, etc.) working on this
repository.

## Goals

- Improve documentation. Be concice, clear, and accurate. Reflect nuances via
  admonitions where appropriate. Only make essential changes, avoid stylistic
  changes.
- Spot mistakes in the docs where they do not correctly reflect the code.
- When refactoring, keep changes to a minimum. For larger edits do the changes
  in stages; for example: reorder the code first, get that committed by the
  user, then edit the functionality.

## Repository Overview

This is a monorepo with a large number of interdependencies. The repo is split
into 4 main categories based on the root folders, each of which have a
`<category>/website` project for their own website:

- `utils` - lots of helper projects that we use to build the main projects.
  Website: https://star.graphile.org ("star" as in "asterisk" as in "everything
  else")
  - `pg-sql2` - safe (and extremely fast) SQL template strings
  - `graphile-config` - standard utils around creating plugins and presets, used
    throughout Graphile projects.
  - `graphile-export` - can export an in-memory GraphQL schema (with
    resolvers/plans) as an executable JS file - particularly useful for
    serverless.
  - `pg-introspection` - exposes the PostgreSQL system catalog via TypeScript
    interfaces with documentation pulled from postgres.
- `grafast` - a new cutting-edge planning and execution engine for GraphQL. Uses
  GraphQL.js for schema elements (`new GraphQLObjectType`, etc) but completely
  replaces execution and output logic. Website: https://grafast.org
  - `grafserv` - a Grafast-optimized server
  - `@grafserv/persisted` - a plugin for Grafserv for persisted operations /
    trusted documents.
  - `ruru` - a Grafast-optimized GraphiQL distribution
  - `@dataplan/pg` - a collection of Grafast "step classes" for dealing with
    PostgreSQL databases
- `graphile-build` - the Graphile Build project produces a GraphQL schema via a
  set of plugins. Website: https://build.graphile.org
  - `graphile-build-pg` - teaches Graphile Build how to add schema elements from
    PostgreSQL resources (tables, functions)
  - `@graphile/simplify-inflection` - a highly recommended plugin that uses
    simpler names in GraphQL (but increases the chance of collisions, hence not
    included in the default experience)
  - `graphile-utils` - the "bread and butter" plugin factories that help people
    do common manipulations of a PostGraphile schema with minimal effort
- `postgraphile` - autogenerated and highly extensible/customiseable GraphQL API
  server/schema generator built using Graphile Build and executed via Grafast.
  Website: https://postgraphile.org
  - `pgl` - a shortcut to the `postgraphile` binary that also takes care of
    installing all the peerDependencies for you (for compatibility with `npx`

## Hard Guardrails (must follow)

1. **Never install dependencies**.
1. **Never edit `package.json`** files unless specifically instructed.
1. **Never edit versioned docs:** files under `*/website/versioned_docs/**` are
   snapshots taken at release time. Edit the source (unversioned) doc instead.
1. **Avoid shell commands unless necessary.**
   - The user already runs compilation and websites in watch mode.
   - The user would rather commit, rebase, and change branches themself - do not
     do this for them.
   - The user would generally rather that you don't run your own commands, but
     you may do so if it is necessary to apply your automated changes to
     code/docs.
1. **Keep scope tight.**
   - Prefer many small PRs over one large PR.
   - Avoid large refactors without an issue/plan.
   - Avoid stylistic rewrites without functional gain.
   - Avoid moving/renaming files/pages unless essential.
   - Avoid changing lockfiles or versions unless essential.

## Allowed Actions

- Read files and make changes to markdown, TypeScript, and `*.test.*` files.
- Write tests; update fixtures and test helpers.
- Update docs (typically under the `<category>/website` folder).
- Add or adjust comments, JSDoc/TSDoc, README snippets.
- Suggest CI/test commands **in prose**; do not execute them.

## Preferred Style

- Follow current formatting/lint rules; **do not** add style-only churn.
- Keep code samples runnable in principle; **do not** add scripts to run them.
- Wrap prose at 80 characters.
- Always use `Gra*fast*` in Markdown when referring to Gra*fast* - the "fast" is
  stylized in italics. When in MDX use the `<Grafast />` component if available,
  otherwise `Gra*fast*` is fine.

When writing Grafast plan resolvers in documentation, try and only do one action
per statement; for example instead of:

```ts
const $invoices = loadMany($customer.get("stripeId"), invoicesByStripId);
```

prefer:

```ts
const $stripeId = $customer.get("stripeId");
const $invoices = loadMany($stripeId, invoicesByStripId);
```

This does not apply to literal object or array values passed as the first
argument to `lambda()`, `sideEffect()`, `loadOne()` or `loadMany()` since these
are "multistep" objects provided for user convenience. Similarly `list()` should
always be called as `list([ ... ])` and `object()` as `object({ ... })` without
separate definition of the argument.

When representing the GraphQL context as a step, `const $context = context();`
should always be used since it's always the same GraphQL context object being
represented (even if the contents are mutated).

Exception to the above: `const $foo = context().get("foo");` is fine, and
preferred over the two statement equivalent.

## Testing Rules

- Prefer **incremental** tests: cover public APIs and critical paths first.
- Use existing test utilities and patterns; mirror nearby tests.
- Keep tests deterministic.

Note: many of the integration tests work by writing `*.test.graphql` files,
which the system will run and capture snapshots of data, plans, errors and
executed SQL. Do not generate these snapshot files, only the `.test.graphql`
files are needed.

Further note: the test suite uses a lot of different schema configurations (see
the `#>` comments at the top of `*.test.graphql` files), so it may be hard to
determine which fields are available. Look for a test in the `schemas` folder
that has a similar configuration, its snapshot can be a guide, or ask.
